# README

This is the content and template for philwilson.org.

The site is generated by https://getzola.org/

The Atom feed XSLT is from https://andrewstiefel.com/style-atom-xsl/

The template is based on https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter by https://bennett.dev/

## Future maintenance notes

In order to add the Atom XSLT and limit the feed to the latest 10 posts I needed to copy the atom.xml template from https://github.com/getzola/zola/tree/master/components/templates/src/builtins and place it into templates/blog which means it could become out of sync.
