I am old and have kids. This means I am old and tired.

I do software management things and, when I’m not too tired, I enjoy being a cliché by playing videogames, reading sci-fi, writing open source code and pining for a past that never existed.

More info on my professional life [is on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamphilwilson/) and many years ago I had some my work featured in [Greasemonkey Hacks](https://archive.org/details/greasemonkeyhack00pilg) and [Firefox Secrets](https://archive.org/details/firefoxsecrets0000chea).

The theme for this blog is based on [simple-dev-blog-zola-starter](https://github.com/bennetthardwick/simple-dev-blog-zola-starter) by [Bennett Hardwick](https://bennett.dev/).
