Apparently there is a thing called [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) which lets you run, amongst other things, a calendar server and a contact directory, both of which will sync with your android phone and [here is a writeup of doing just that](http://www.flailingmonkey.com/2013/03/26/moving-contacts-calendar-google/).
