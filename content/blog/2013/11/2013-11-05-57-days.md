Yesterday, with the return of my family from holiday, I forgot to make changes to any of [my projects in GitHub](https://github.com/pipwilson/), and broke my commit streak at 57 days.

Initially I’d aimed for making changes on 30 consecutive days, just to try and get some momentum up in making progress on a couple of fairly low-key projects that hadn’t been going anywhere, and although I did cheat a few times (GitHub counts things like opening issues on a repo as ‘activity’ and I have plenty of bugs and features!), the vast majority of my activity was real commits, and I found 30 to be quite easy.

I think this is definitely something I’ll try again, but probably in 30-day chunks (each day only tends to give me ~30 minutes free to do any coding at home!), and probably with a more well-defined plan about what I’m actually expecting myself to ship within that time.

Anyway, despite the fact that I’ve finally broken my run, I’m pleased that I managed to get so much higher than I’d originally aimed for. Onwards!
