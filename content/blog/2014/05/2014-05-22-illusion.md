Warnings and apologies: 6am introspection ahead!

In [Dan Hon’s latest newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/danhon/letters/episode-eighty-five-solid-1-of-2-requests-cities-and-technology) he briefly mentions the academic theory of some of the work at ETech in the past (compared to some of the advertorial at [O’Reilly Solid](http://solidcon.com/solid2014/)).

I have a grudging acceptance that being older, and having two kids, but still being interested in Things as well as games, and, y’know occassionally going outside means I have to pick and choose what I spend my time on. I used to spend a lot of time, pre-kid, on taking some new or interesting piece of technology and making a thing. There used to be an [XUL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL) interface to this blog, for example.

But the edges are less clear to me now. Or at least the bits-only edges are unclear. There’s obviously a load of really interesting stuff going on with sensors and arduinos and the Raspberry Pi, and, one small step up from that, plenty of [programmable](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/linkbot-that-modular-robot-youve-always-wanted-is-now-on-kickstarter) [toy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24835410) [robots](http://www.rapiro.com/).

I suppose that areas like [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) are where the current excitement is – an area with a dense spec and, when I last looked, a dearth of examples.

Because I sit in a world which straddles Java and PHP and has a toe in Ruby I see things like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and think “hurray, a replacement for those [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) scripts!” but it turns out they’re barely that. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) appears, and is great for packaging and distributing customised images of virtual machines, but again the bits I care about are just [a wrapper around other tools](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/). Where’s the meat? There’s a lot of work going on in front-end JavaScript application development, but, [like Joe Gregorio](http://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto), I have a whole other rant about that.
