I have started working from home one day a week to help make up the hours I lose by taking my son to school in the mornings.

This week, on my day at home, I wanted to have a remote talk with some people in the office. “Easy”, we all thought, “we’ll just use Google Hangouts”. Wrong.

Laggy, constant dropouts, confusing UI. In the end I hung up in frustration and we IMd to exchange Skype details and used that, which was near-perfect.

It turns out that having more than 10 years experience of running a product does actually make a difference. Who knew?
