So, despite my [sterling attempt to delude myself last year](http://philwilson.org/blog/2013/11/57-days) it’s been years since I’ve been a developer rather than a manager, and it was about the time of this change in my role that this blog started to die out.

All I have now are opinions and guidance, which the internet is far too full of for me to want to add to (plus I am still very management-naive in a number of ways), but there’s always been room to contribute something new in the form of code.

But.

Off the back of that 57 day coding streak I decided to set myself a few other goals.

I keep a private blog where I write about my kids. Until the beginning of the year I’d posted about once a month and they mostly started with “its been far too long since I last posted, but…” and then detailed just the last few days, because when you’re the dad of a one year old, that’s all you can remember.

So far I’ve made twenty posts this year, including every day in March so far. I’m using an android app for this called goal tracker, although once installed it annoyingly just calls itself “calendar”. It has nice big ticks for each day, and this seems to be working.

This year and the end of last year ha vee also seen big streaks in “one second everyday” and “calorie counter fitness tracker”, the latter of which I use to feed extra data into my fitbit profile.

All of which is to say that I’ve been focusing in rather than out, and making sure I can make a daily commitment to something.

Being able to maintain even this somewhat small but continuous level of creativity (taking a video, writing a blog post, thinking about what I’m eating and where I’m going and how far it is), plus a couple of catalysts at work have helped me to think about the problems (and some more fun non-problems) I could get my teeth into both in and out of work.

Hopefully this will lead to a few more things being shipped to the outside as well as the inside, and can stop being worried that I simply don’t have anything to say anymore.
