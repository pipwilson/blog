I remember being a new developer and thinking that [vertical alignment of code](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/11/why-i-vertically-align-my-code-and-you-should-too/), whilst having some minor upsides, was just too damn ugly to do.

Now I’m much older and the less time I have to spend parsing someone else’s code before I can see if it’s [correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_%28computer_science%29) or not, the better.

Vertical alignment, the vast majority of the time, does make code vastly easier to read, and although it may have some diff-based downsides, they tend to be one-off rather than perpetual. I know which cost I’d rather bear.
