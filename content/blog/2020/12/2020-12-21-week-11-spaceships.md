- I have (nearly) finished the main story mode of Star Wars: Squadrons, which is short, but satisfyingly so, and I’ll definitely give the earlier levels another try. It really wants you to play online though (of the [48 trophies on the PS4 version](https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/11504-star-wars-squadrons), only 17 can be completed in single player and some of those are pretty tricky to get), which I’ve given a bit of a go and seems to work well most of the time. I normally shy away from online games on non-Nintendo systems because of y’know, the humans. So far I haven’t had to hear anyone else, so all is good.
- I love everything [Johanna Rothman writes about management and delivery](https://www.jrothman.com/blog/mpd/). Everything is easy to read, understand and, depending on your org, easy to apply. Brilliant.
- It was last week, but it’s still amazing to watch [the video of a test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket](https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-launches-and-crashes-its-starship-mars-rocket/). Not \_entirely\_ successful, and I can’t help be horrified at the thought of humans in it as it “belly flops” at6:30 and hurtles towards the ground!
- Season 2 of [Hilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_(TV_series)) starts this weekend, hooray!
