- We are nearly at the Christmas holidays! Come on people, you can make it!
- We took our daughter to see Father Christmas making his way down a nearby road, on a sleigh being pulled by a tractor. We are in the west country, after all.
- As part of my “classics I’ve never read” series I am reading [Little Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women). I like the story, and the writing, but each time we get a homily about how hard work, modesty and gratitude are all that’s needed to succeed in life, I want to push the mother off a cliff. Let’s see her get out of that with just a [Protestant work ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic).
- Did I mention my daughter now owns a singing Christmas jumper? This is what 2020 has reduced me to.
- I am still very much enjoying the [Something Rhymes with Purple](https://play.acast.com/s/somethingrhymeswithpurple) podcast. Great lightweight listening and learning.This week two lovely pieces of art have made me happy. The first is [watching Tony Hart drawing with pastels](https://twitter.com/BBCArchive/status/1334139003621105664) and the second is [Watercolor by Shibasaki as he paints a tree](https://youtu.be/F_Bl7JXQUTg). Both videos are so relaxing to watch and inspirational in their approach.
- I am also enjoying [Star Wars: Squadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Squadrons), a direct descendent of [X-Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing), which I played as a teen. Pew pew pew!
