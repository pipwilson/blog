- Dear neighbours: starting your DIY on our shared bedroom wall at 8am on Sunday morning is Just Not Right.
- [The Queenâ€™s Gambit](https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304) was bloody excellent. Wonderfully made, shot and styled throughout. A joy to watch.
- Paper Mario and the Origami King is my new low-tension story-progression game.
- I have started reading Ivanhoe, and am feeling pretty bad for the Saxons.
- It is very muddy now autumn is here, yet very few cyclists I see have a rear mudguard and so they are all wearing a single-stripe uniform on their backs.
- Africa has a land area of 30 million square miles. Probably once every two years I go to [whichever site is still up](https://thetruesize.com/) to play with map projections but I do love [Visualizing the True Size of Africa](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/map-true-size-of-africa/)
- In three weeks my eBay account will be 19 years old. 19! I have bought 44 items in that time, or an average of 2.3 items per year. I have never used it to sell anything.
- I think I might crack in my need to play [Wind Waker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker) again but since my Wii U is in the loft, it may have to be the GameCube version on the Dolphin emulator (using the [Hypatia texture pack](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-hypatia-s-tloz-the-wind-waker-hd-pack-v2-0) to make it a bit closer to the Wind Waker HD graphics).
