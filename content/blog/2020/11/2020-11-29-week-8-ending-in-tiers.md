- Through Lockdown I and Lockdown II (The Revenge), our family have been sitting down at dinner and doing a quiz posted on [Twitter by @forwardnotback](https://twitter.com/forwardnotback). Today’s highlight was being reminded of [the Mike Flowers Pops cover of Wonderwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfZshkNZRw&feature=youtu.be).
- I have started listening to [the Something Rhymes with Purple podcast](https://play.acast.com/s/somethingrhymeswithpurple/) whilst making dinner. It’s hosted by [Suzie Dent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Dent) and [Gyles Brandreth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyles_Brandreth) and it’s pretty light but entertaining fare.
- Gyles has [a book out at the moment about learning and reciting poetry](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Gyles-Brandreth/Dancing-By-The-Light-of-The-Moon--Over-250-poems-to-read-relish-and-recite/23966356), which is something I haven’t done for years, but [you can read the first chapter of it on Google Books](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/_/02qdDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0). Maybe I’ll ask for it for Chrimstas? I remember Gyles B from TV:am and the “Woolly Jumper” days in the Houses of Parliament and certainly didn’t think I’d still be reading and listening to him 30 years later.
- This week has felt like the most 2020 week of all of 2020 so far. Here’s hoping for a bit of Christmas spirit next week.
