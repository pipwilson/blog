Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game to play during the Great Coronavirus Lockdown of 2020. Even without the bits where you get rewarded for Just Buying More Stuff, it’s a handy reminder whilst we’re not at work of the rewards that capitalism provides for exploiting nature.

Anyway.

In the game you can create little 32×32 artworks which you can display on easels, or floors or your own clothes. Drawing your own pictures is relaxing, but hard.

Getty [have provided a tool](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator) ([explanatory blog post here](https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/how-to-build-an-art-museum-in-animal-crossing/)) which lets you convert any of their artworks into a QR code which you can scan on your phone and send to the game.

For example, [here is Picasso’s self-portrait](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator?iiif-content=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nga.gov%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fiiif%2Fpresentation%2Fmanifest.json%3FcultObj%3Aid%3D106382):

They have also provided [an importer](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator#iiifloader) which takes an [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) metadata file and allows you to send the image described by the metadata into your game. There is a list of [IIIF-participating organisations](https://iiif.io/community/#participating-institutions) but navigating those sites and finding works which actually have the IIIF metadata is a giant pain in the ass, so I gave up with that list and wondered about [the National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/). It’s not on the IIIF’s list, but it turns out that they do have a [research wiki](https://research.ng-london.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) and do actually have [a test IIIF server](https://media.ng-london.org.uk/iiif/examples/)!

All you have to do is search and find a painting you like, right-click the red and blue “iiif” logo in the top right corner, copy the URL it links to and paste it into [the importer](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator#iiifloader). With luck you’ll then just need to scroll back up to see your imported painting, ready for you to scan!

This means that you can import works like [van Gogh’s Sunflowers](https://experiments.getty.edu/ac-art-generator?iiif-content=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.ng-london.org.uk%2Fiiif%2F00C-02Q6-0000%2Fmanifest.json#step2) straight into Animal Crossing to impress all your island visitors. Have fun decorating!
