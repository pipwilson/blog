- [Hatches Open, Station Crew Expands to Six](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2020/10/14/hatches-open-station-crew-expands-to-six-2/)
- [Jo Whiley had an awesome interview with Skin from Skunk Anansie earlier in the week;](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000ndyq) one of my favourite broadcasters with an incredible singer and a great playlist.
- I started playing [Trine 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trine_4:_The_Nightmare_Prince) and it is charming, very pretty, and so far it’s low effort and I love it.
- I have 2 kids and each week one gets [The Beano](https://www.beano.com/) and the other gets [The Phoenix](https://thephoenixcomic.co.uk/) – both comics are well loved in this house. They are both brilliant in different ways and I recommend them both.
- The latest Morrigan Crow book by Jessica Townsend, [Hollowpox](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Jessica-Townsend/Hollowpox--The-Hunt-for-Morrigan-Crow-Book-3/24327865), is out!
- I spent some of my time this week smashing my face into custom [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) templates. It was not fun, especially when they work differently (or not at all) on different platforms. Didn’t we solve these problems ten years ago?
- Like so many other office workers I’m working from home at the moment, in particular from a desk in my living room which looks out of the front window. Because of where we live, most days I get to watch horses walk past my house whilst I’m in a meeting, as people learn to ride. It’s awesome.
