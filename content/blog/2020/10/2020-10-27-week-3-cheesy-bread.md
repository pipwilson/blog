- This week has mostly been brought to you by Marks and Spencer’s Extra Mature and Red Leicester cob. Deeeeelicious.
- My son is playing [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) all the time. I think he’s on his 10th or 11th playthrough. When he’s not playing, he’s listening to the soundtrack.
- I am still playing [Trine 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trine_4:_The_Nightmare_Prince), which is absolutely beautiful, very charming, and only slightly challenging, which is just how I like my games in 2020.
- I have read [The Maltese Falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_(novel)). It is noir with a capital-N, having a manipulative, selfish antihero who is completely lacking in human empathy.
- Leaves are falling off the fig tree in scores, which means it is now officially autumn.
- Friday was an [INSET day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inset_day), so I found myself eating flapjacks, drinking tea and listening to Radio 2 whilst my kids played a boardgame upstairs. Hello middle age and middle class.
- SpaceX have now made [100 successful flights](https://www.spacex.com/updates/starlink-mission-10-24-2020/index.html).
- It’s now half-term, my family is all at home whilst I am, so there are some fun meeting backgrounds for other people to enjoy I’m sure, but for me, I’ll just enjoy not having to make packed lunches every night!
