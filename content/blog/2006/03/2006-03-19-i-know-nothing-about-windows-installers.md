I don’t know anything about configuring or using Windows installers. Seriously.

From January to February, [my contact form](http://philwilson.org/contact/) was broken, since I fixed it, I’ve had four messages from people asking for help fixing their installers. I was completely baffled, but a quick web search later showed that my namesake is a Microsoft MVP who wrote [The Definitive Guide to Windows Installer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590592972/qid=1142770294/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl/203-8860151-1661508).

Just to make it clear: that’s not me.
