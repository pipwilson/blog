Though you’ve created new market space, the share of that market that’s valuable in the real world is tiny; though many might *want* to use this set of services, only geeks *can* use them – you’ve built a better mousetrap, but only [guys like this](http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2005/11/kistlers_profil_1.shtml) can figure out how to use it.

Though everyone can figure them out, they create little market space: only geeks want these services – you’ve built a better mousetrap, but it only catches very, very small [subset](http://www.arkive.org/species/ARK/mammals/Apodemus_flavicollis/) of mice.

I really like that quote from [The Two Chasms of 2.0](http://www.bubblegeneration.com/2006/02/getting-ninged-getting-flocked-two.cfm), both Flock and Ning are theoretically very *good*, but neither are particularly *useful*.
