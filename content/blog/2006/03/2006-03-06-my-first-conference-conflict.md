I really really wanted to go to [@Media 2006](http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/) (15th-16th June, [upcoming](http://upcoming.org/event/48899/ "@Media 2006 on upcoming.org")), having missed it last year, but Iâ€™ve been asked to talk at the [Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/) (14th-16th June, [upcoming](http://upcoming.org/event/61789 "IWMW 2006 on upcoming.org")).

With any luck, my proposed talks (one on wikis and one on microformats â€“ despite [everything](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/05/can-someone-explain-microformats-to-me.html "Can someone explain microformats to me?") [Iâ€™ve](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/06/microformats-and-aggregation.html "Microformats and aggregation") [said](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/11/microformats-understood.html "Microformats understood")) will be rejected ðŸ˜‰
