After a mail from [Rod Begbie](http://groovymother.com/) I’ve finally decided to move to a free, open-source aggregator which actually has active development: [Gregarius](http://gregarius.net/). Sorry [FeedOnFeeds](http://feedonfeeds.com/).

My FeedOnFeeds database contains around 30,000 posts – is it worth importing them into Gregarius? That’s a whole lot of content, some of which may disappear from the web in the future, and possibly available for some kind of analysis.

I’ll have a few FoF customisations to port to Gregarius plugins, but a lot of them are now core features in Gregarius or already available as [plugins](http://plugins.gregarius.net/).
