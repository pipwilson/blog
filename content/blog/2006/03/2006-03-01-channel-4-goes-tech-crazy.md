All next week, [Jon Snow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow) will be reporting from Iran.

According to [Krishnan Guru-Murthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnan_Guru-Murthy), “You’ll be able to check up on Jon’s progress by following his blog which you can see on our website at [channel4.com/iran](http://www.channel4.com/iran) and he’ll also be posting podcasts”

At which point my girlfriend quipped “yeah, and then he’ll be setting up a wiki to document his experiences”.
