That would be great! I got full of ideas like using a toggle button (and store the old content in a variable for undo), etc. But I don’t uh… have the time? 🙂

Best regards!"

Actually, I think Ctrl-Z should work fine for undoing the Textile-to-HTML conversion without needing to add a toggle button, and you could just click the button a second time for the redo. At least, the Instant Markdown script that I hacked together based on Instant Textile allows for a normal Ctrl-Z undo, and I don’t think I changed anything that would affect that."
