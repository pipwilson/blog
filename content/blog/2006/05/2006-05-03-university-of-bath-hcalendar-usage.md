After a bit of discussion with a chap at work, individual items featured at the [University of Bath’s What’s On](http://www.bath.ac.uk/whats-on/ "What's on") now sport [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) in their markup.

For example: [Daytime T’ai Chi Beginners’ Class for the over 50’s](http://www.bath.ac.uk/whats-on/getevent.php?event_id=2867&catId=ALL).

Individual events can now be added to your Google Calendar using [this Greasemonkey script from Elias Torres](http://torrez.us/archives/2006/04/13/431/ "hCalendar + Google Calendar Reminders") or exported into the tool of your choice using the [Tails Export](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2240/) Firefox extension.

For what it’s worth, we spent vastly longer talking about doing it (an hour?) than actually doing it (minutes).

I’d also like to take this moment to curse, [yet again](http://philwilson.org/blog/2003/08/gareths-keyboard-config-has-problem.html), the imbecilic designer who put a “suspend computer” button directly above the “Escape” key on my keyboard.
