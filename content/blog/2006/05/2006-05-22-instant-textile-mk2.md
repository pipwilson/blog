Back in November, Tiago Silveira updated the JavaScript Textile implementation that powers [my Textile Greasemonkey script](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/03/textile-your-textareas-with.html), but I just hadn’t got around to rolling in his changes, so he’s done the sensible thing, and [rolled his own](http://jroller.com/page/dukejeffrie/?anchor=textile_in_javascript_greasemonkey_edition). Good work!

On my desktop at home I have a completely rewritten version that has a nicer UI (html and rendered preview) and rewritten rendering engine which I wrote a year ago, and hadn’t released. I should probably drop my rendering engine in favour of Tiago’s, fold in my UI stuff and release.
