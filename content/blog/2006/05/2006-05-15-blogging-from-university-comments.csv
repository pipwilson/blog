The nice thing about wordpress is that, should you want to, you can take the good bits and put them into your own app as you wish.

It’s actually a really nice idea… I suppose the greatest difficulty would be managing the list of those who get blogs (students, etc.) or perhaps even the massive database the scheme could produce. This is a dream UI project in many ways, too.

I would be interesting in seeing where this goes, if anywhere."

“Right away I would be thinking custom PHP option”

See, that’s not going to work because it means a dedicating at least one developer full-time to the job of creating it, and the massive maintenance burden this would bring.

If we use an existing solution (with any changes we make ideally committed back to the main codebase) we get a free upgrade path when changes and fixes are added.

Again, we’d rely on the main product for most of the UI, but we don’t have any UI designers in-house so it’s not as if we’d come up with anything better anyway. 🙂"

Besides, WP delivers HTML with superior quality than most (all?) roller themes; you have far more control over the urls that WP generates, and the defaults are much better.

By the time you need to scale it so high that MySQL can’t handle it, your options will be different.

It’s a sad thing that the Java community hardly ever delivers good community tools."
874,2006-05-22T10:54:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Surely the performance issue is one of a hosted solution vs. not?

I agree with you in terms of extensibility, and mention this in my post, but this probably isn’t an issue for a hosted solution – we probably wouldn’t offer the ability to extend their blogs and off the top of my head there’s no missing functionality that we’d want to bundle straight off."

It doesn’t include the patches for 2.X, but it works anyway…"

Don’t forget [Lyceum](http://lyceum.ibiblio.org/).
