Kathy Sierra, user experience supremo, has written a lovely post on why [Tech t-shirts aren’t sexy enough](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/tech_tshirts_ar.html) – this was wonderfully exemplified at Apachecon Europe which I attended this year. As we arrived and were handed our XXL tees, the girls handing them out simply said “Sorry, they’re all really really big – we’re expecting a lot of Americans”. I think I saw about two people wearing them the whole week. Personally, I live in mine when I go camping.
