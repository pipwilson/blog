And when you’ve got countries around the world that span multiple timezones, that AREN’T America, like Australia for example, you end up with a really nasty sliding scale of timezone offsets. East US to West Australia would be about 13 hours, West US to East Australia about 19 hours.

Just bite the bullet, use a standard and let the n00bs figure out for themselves what it all means."
