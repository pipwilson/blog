At my last workplace, where I was employed between 2003 and 2005, we had a web services system which used SOAP across two different programming languages (Java and C++) and had a potential future in another two (.Net and Python). We had some, what you might call, practical considerations. If you like, you can check the dates on [the OASIS spec](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16790/wss-v1.1-spec-os-SOAPMessageSecurity.pdf)

Oh, how we laughed. Even the idea of trying to do this in a semi-secure way without SSL was met with hollow laughter. I think it’s this which makes [the current fuss](http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2006/12/rest_security_o_1.html) [so funny](http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/12/01/restful-security/).

Whether things are different now I truly don’t know, and I’m glad that I don’t. I wouldn’t go back to that fool’s gold if you paid me.
