I was doing OK with [BlogBridge](http://www.blogbridge.com/), but in the last month it’s dropped all my data twice and then prevented me from re-importing all my feeds by disabling all the feed action buttons and menu items such as “add feed, import feed” etc.

Luckily it does an automatic export of your subscription list as OPML every time you make a change to the list of feeds that you read (in %profile%.bbfinalbackups), so importing it into another reader should be easy.

It’s also lucky that I don’t use any of the special features like “pinning”, or smartfeeds, because I’d be royally pissed off; as it is I’m just quite annoyed that I’m going to have to trawl, yet again, the painful mess of Windows desktop aggregators.
