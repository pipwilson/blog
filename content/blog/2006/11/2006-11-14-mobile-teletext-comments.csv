Maybe something in the accept header to include wml or something ?

Just somewhere to start."

888 – I wish!"

I should rig my keyboard so that if I’m in a terminal and enter double-quotes it gives me an electric shock.

I even noticed that it was running in the background but didn’t even stop to ask why. My excuse is that it was late. The *reason* is that I was stupid 🙂

Thanks very Paul for the hyper-useful code, too!"
