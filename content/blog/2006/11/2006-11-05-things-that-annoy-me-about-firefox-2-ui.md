- No close button on every tab
- No close button at the right of the tab bar
- highlight text, right-click, search uses the selected Search Box engine, not Google
- scrolling tab bar
- constant switching between “extensions” and “add-ons” between Firefox versions
- atrocious options pane for Windows users (this is actually a Firefox 1.5+ problem)
- massively slow first startup time without a splashscreen
- terrible UI for session saving (text box has become a dropdown, with no clues)
- ‘tabs’ and ‘feeds’ options tabs are poorly designed and laid out
- spell-checker dictionary doesn’t come bundled with your localised build

More as they occur to me.
