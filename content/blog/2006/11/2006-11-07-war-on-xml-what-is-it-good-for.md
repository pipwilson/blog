> Were switching to XML a requirement for reaping compelling benefits, the public would indubitably have moved. So would the majority browser engine.

So if the majority browser engine did support XML, this presumably brings us to the question of what would those compelling benefits to the public be?

Aristotle has updated with a response to the question he thinks I asked of his post, which I didn’t. Rather than quote it all, feel free to go and read it on [his blog post](http://plasmasturm.org/log/447/)

My question is, what would those compelling features of XHTML 1.5 be? What could those new features at the time have been? Would they have been compelling *enough* to encourage the move to XML?

Maybe I’m even asking (in a very broad sense) whether the changes which the WHATWG (and apparently TB-L) are suggesting, are compelling, in and of themselves, to the public, now.
