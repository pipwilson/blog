I thought I was going mad this morning as I was reading the [metro](http://www.metro.co.uk/) (a free daily newspaper in the UK) – there seemed to be ads for games \*everywhere\*. I realised a few pages in that they were all for the Xbox 360.

In fact, it was so outrageously obvious (two two-page spreads, including a Dead Or Alive calendar), that [Kotaku also picked up on it](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/microsoft/microsoft-goes-ad-crazy-in-the-uk-215514.php) and went as far as to photograph all the ads [and put them online](http://www.kotaku.com/photogallery/xboxmetroadsuk). To clarify, that’s about 42 ads in a 56-page newspaper.

Note to Microsoft: it *is* possible for you to spread your marketing you know – you don’t have to blow the budget all on one day!
