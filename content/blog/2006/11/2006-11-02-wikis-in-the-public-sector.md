One of my colleagues, [Marieke Guy](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/m.guy/), has just written a puntastically-titled article entitled [Wiki or Won’t He? A Tale of Public Sector Wikis](http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue49/guy/) in the [UKOLN](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ "UK Office for Library Networking") online periodical [Ariadne](http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/) in which I get extensively quoted. I hadn’t realised when I tacked those few paragraphs onto the end of the short questionnaire, it was going to be quoted directly, so I apologise in advance for my poor use of English.

Tomorrow I’ll be talking at [UKOLN’s national Wiki Workshop](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/wiki-workshop-2006/) in Birmingham about [evaluating wikis for rollout at universities](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/wiki-workshop-2006/people/#wilson). It’s only a 15 minute talk (most of the day is spent in discussion panels), and I have trouble keeping just sentences that short, so I have no idea how I’m going to shut myself up. It should be a fun experience anyway.
