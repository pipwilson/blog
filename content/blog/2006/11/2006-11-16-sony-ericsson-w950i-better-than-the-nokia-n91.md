I like Symbian, and I can write code for it. This has mostly limited me to the Nokia brand of phones so far.

I am interested in getting a new phone, but am slightly out of touch on the latest devices.

Hence, my astonishment – the [Sony Ericsson W950i](http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&ver=4001&template=pp1_1_1&zone=pp&lm=pp1&pid=10391) runs Symbian.

Also, it appears to come bundled with mobile browser par excellence, Opera 8.

It also has a 4GB memory (can’t yet tell if this is hard drive based like the N91 or flash).

It is a very simple-looking handset, which definitely appeals to me after the years of the 6600 and now my 6630.

I guess the only bad sign to-date is this:
