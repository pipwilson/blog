I hope that you’re not putting a lot of faith in the new biometric passports (my wife just got one) because a[ny half-capable programmer with an RFID reader can obtain the details stored in them](http://www.guardian.co.uk/idcards/story/0,,1950226,00.html).

> Within minutes of applying the three passports to the reader, the information from all of them has been copied and the holders’ images appear on the screen of Laurie’s laptop.

The information on the chip isn’t encrypted, but the conversation with it is, but the key is human-readable from the passport itself. Utter, utter madness.
