Obviously losing data is not part of the plan and it would be valuable to learn what happened so we could fix it. But either way, appologies for the trouble.

I’m not terribly impressed to be honest; but then again, I’m incredibly picky. The added-value features are good, but I’m not really convinced about the core reading model. Or rather it’s not how I’d choose to read my feeds, and given that I spend quite a lot of time there, I’m pretty inflexible about that.

Pito – I’ll follow up on email. Thanks for the quick comment."
