Namely, applications that use JavaScript (aka “Ajax”) and for testing cross-browser compatibility. The very first test case for Selenium was for a fancy Ajaxy pop-up window that sometimes worked in in IE and other times worked in Mozilla. (I needed it to work in both browsers all the time!) I wrote Selenium so that I could certify on every build that my app worked in the actual browsers that my users used day-to-day. Protocol drivers like HTTPUnit don’t and can’t give me that level of confidence. On the other hand, there is a cost to driving the browser — it’s slow, because launching and driving a browser (and really, any UI– web or not– is slow). So, out of the box, Selenium’s not an effective load testing tool without lots of resources, but then again it wasn’t designed to be. 🙂 In those cases, HTTPUnit or JMeter are what you’re looking for."

Yes, you’re right of course, and I do really like Selenium, I just wish I could run it in some way on our server machine which doesn’t have any kind of windowing system installed, let alone a browser.

Just wishful thinking – really it goes to show how good Selenium is!"

We use [Xvfb](http://www.xfree86.org/current/Xvfb.1.html) to satisfy Firefox’s need for a display and it all works very well. A simple google search for “selenium xvfb” will turn up a few [good](http://weblog.greenpeace.org/it/2006/04/virtual_framebuffers_firefox_s.html) [articles](http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SRC/Selenium-RC+and+Continuous+Integration) to get you started.

I’d be happy to answer any questions (jasonmtu–at–yahoo.com)."
