Can’t be there, but would like to see your materials should they be available afterwards.

Any tips for us on how to actually motivate people to contribute?

I’ve resorted to Wiki’ing everything and sending links out in the hope of it catching on – has to be superior to an inbox full of FYIs."

I will definitely put the slides up after the event, and they’ll probably appear on the conference website as well.

If you’re trying to make more people use the wiki, then that’s exactly what you need to do – I’m guessing you’re in a small team, so get one other person interested and get them to start putting information on the wiki. For example, do you have a list of projects plus a description of what they are, their status and so on? That should be on the wiki.

Are you doing any work that most people don’t know about? Like you’ve posted that Javascript code on your blog recently – put it on your wiki linked from a “code snippets” page maybe.

Depending on your team and exactly what you do, maybe a “tips and tricks with PHP” page. Make it an internal point of reference for the rest of the developers and encourage them to add their own advice to everyone else.

The world’s your oyster in theory, but the content does need to be compelling in the first place to get people looking at it."
