Or rather, I used a hacked-up version of Performancing because I don’t like it using &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; when I’ve been converted to &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;.

It’s not perfect, not by a long stretch, but it’s fast, free and easy to hack (it’s a Firefox extension – so loads of Javascript and CSS)."

Maybe as we start using ActionScript 3 and Flex I can write a nice one in Flash and make a tidy little cross-platform blog writer as an exercise. Perhaps. Maybe."

I must admit that I do keep meaning to have a proper look at it, but so far haven’t got around to it."

in fact flex is a framework. i used to call it “flash for for real developers” 🙂

the real power of flex is, that you can develop powerfullweb 2.0 apps very fast and simple."
