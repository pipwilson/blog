I’ll be delivering a talk on [Evaluating Wikis: A Case Study](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/wiki-workshop-2006/talks/wilson/) at the [Exploiting The Potential Of Wikis](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/wiki-workshop-2006/) workshop put on by [UKOLN](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/) on Friday 3rd November 2006 where I’ll be giving a rundown of how we selected which wiki engine to roll out at the University of Bath.

This means that I’ll have to actually, you know, evaluate some wikis and roll something out before then, but come along! It’ll be a hoot! Past comments on my talks have included “Very interesting”, “Philip is a real live wire!” and “Ran out of time” – how can you resist? 😉
