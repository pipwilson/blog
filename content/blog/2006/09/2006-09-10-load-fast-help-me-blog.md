This blog is currently powered by [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). The only two desktop posting tools I’ve used and liked are [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) and [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/). The problem with both of them – or at least, my *perceived* problem with them is that they take too long to load. Quite often I just want to post some idle thoughts on a subject without putting in too much effort, but I know that having to load one of these tools will probably take around ten seconds, by which time I’ll either no longer care, or have expanded the thoughts to the extent that I’ll save the post up for more fuller treatment later (which of course, never happens) and so it goes unblogged and forgotten.

[Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) I can understand being slow to load – I mean, hey! it’s a .NET application, what do you expect? [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) though just seems to do it to annoy me. Well, not really. It’s a native (non-.NET) Windows application but I would guess that before the window appears and it lets you start typing it performs some checks to make sure the server is up.

I couldn’t care less if the server is up.

All I want to do is write, and if the server’s not running, then tell me in the status bar, save my text when I get to the end, minimise to tray, and publish when it comes up again (or let me close and choose to publish when I start it next time). Just let me get on with hitting the keys.
