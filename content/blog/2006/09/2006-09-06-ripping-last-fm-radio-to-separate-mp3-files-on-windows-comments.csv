If the files are named correectly then what I tend to do is use MediaMonkey to sort out the tags, however I also have some unnamed songs which I’d like MusicBrainz to sort out for me.

Cheers for the Pandora ripping link, Anon – the other alternative I’ve seen is <http://pyrcast.com/index.html> but I’ve not used either of them."

There’s that Java-based thing, Pandora’s Jar, which can automate some of it but I found it was getting far too many songs named incorrectly – especially if I swapped channels – so I went the manual way and kept an eye on the files being downloaded."

wget <http://localhost:1881/ban>  
wget <http://localhost:1881/love>  
wget <http://localhost:1881/np> &lt;–refreshes  
using the /rtp and /nortp and the end there will turn on or off the record to profile..
