Last night my wife and I sat down to watch the programme about the recent drugs trials disaster in the UK (she used to work in the industry) when we suddenly realised that we were going to miss Extras. The first thing my wife said was “can’t we just [watch it online](http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/) later?”.

It hadn’t even occurred to me! Cue professional embarrassment.
