I’m currently highly distressed – it turns out that the latest version of [FeedReader](http://www.feedreader.com/) is really good (that is to say, it’s not a Java or .Net app and so actually runs at an acceptable speed on my 2GHz, 1GB RAM machine), which means the yawning pit of infovorism has opened before me once again. Maybe this time I could keep it to under three hundred feeds? That’s not too many is it?
