[Google has acquired JotSpot](http://www.jot.com/google/faq.html) (coverage also on [the Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/spot-on.html))

I’ve been evaluating wikis for rollout at work for a good while now, and the overwhelming impression I came away with was one of disappointment. Almost all of the hosted wikis are very poor indeed. You see the editing on Wikipedia? That’s almost as good as it gets. JotSpot essentially provided hosted wikis with wikipedia-like features (i.e. not many) but with added [enterprisey bolt-ons](http://www.jot.com/gallery/) like MS Word import, project management, bug tracking, spreadsheets and so on. This is where the value in Jot lies, not in the actual wiki software, which is distinctly average.

Jot had just put out a beta version of JotSpot Server – a VMWare-based system you could download and use to run your own hosted JotSpot install. We tried it out as [part of our evaluation](http://philwilson.org/blog/2006/10/wiki-comparison-matrix.html) of many the different wiki tools. Other than being very hard to set up and actually get going, it really did provide companies with a way to get JotSpot inside their firewall. No more. From an email today:

> At this time, we are no longer planning to offer JotSpot Wiki Server.
> You can continue to use the beta version for the 90-day Term you
> agreed to in the click-through JotSpot Wiki Server Beta Agreement
> but we are no longer providing support for the product. (The Term may
> be different for those of you who signed a paper version of the beta
> agreement.) Once your Term has expired, per the agreement, we ask you
> to destroy all copies of the software you have installed.

So now, if you want something inside your firewall, it’s pretty much [Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) or nothing (we chose Confluence anyway btw – it’s amazing and far, far ahead of everything else).

<ins>According to a JotSpot employee:

> I work for JotSpot and just wanted to make a quick clarification that the JotBox product line has not been cancelled. All new business has been suspended for now as we join Google including sales of our JotBox hardware appliances. That being said, we currently have a number of customers actively using JotBoxes which we will continue to upgrade, support, and maintain.

Well, that doesn’t quite match up with the email I received from the Sales team as I quoted above: <q>we are no longer planning to offer JotSpot Wiki Server</q>. I can understand some confusion, given what’s going on, but this is kind of important to both Google and Jot’s customers, surely?</ins>
