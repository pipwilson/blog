The [more](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/007624.html) I [read](http://torrez.us/archives/2006/10/09/501/), the more tempted I am to bite the bullet, [buy “web hosting” space](http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html) on DreamHost, and just start [rsyncing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) all of both my and my wife’s data up there.

Downsides?

1. ADSL lines have terrible upload rates
2. Remote backup means we may not have access if the network is down (which does happen quite regularly)

Overall though, I think remote backup is the way to go. I am far, far too lazy to do regular backups to DVD, and definitely too lazy to copy my backup disks every few years in case of media failures. Outsourcing the lot makes a lot of sense to me. I’d probably try and keep a local DVD-based backup as well, but that would be just for convenience rather than the master copy.
