<q cite="http://del.icio.us/url/5d26b2d8ae6c460f04575b46fa158dfb">Television is so bloody confusing and irritatingly designed.</q>

I finally left the [30%](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5360904.stm "About 72.5% of UK homes already have digital television.") and got a [Freeview](http://www.freeview.co.uk/) box [with built-in 80GB PVR](http://www.pvruk.co.uk/reviews.cfm?attributes.ProductID=45&Model=PVR80%20,%20PVR160 "Digihome 80GB") at the weekend, and gosh isn’t it exciting? Apart from the new-found ability to watch [Batfink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batfink) whenever I like, I can now watch [Torchwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood) on broadcast night. This is very exciting, but I suspect the raft of channels which have now been opened up to me and the ways of navigating between them are a giant wave which will shortly break on the beach of my mind.

So far, I’d give it four out of five. Very impressive for £100.
