The important point is that you need someone to prime the wiki. Most people will not care about it at all as long as it’s mostly empty. Few people care enough to contribute without getting anything in return. There has to be a certain concentration of content first so that people will start *finding* useful information – as soon as you cross that line, they will start *adding* information (often for purely selfish reasons like wanting to remember some detail that isn’t currently mentioned on the page, and which they don’t want to forget), thereby creating a virtuous circle.

I’ve seen this transformation on another wiki and it’s amazing to watch. It putters along nearly comatose for *months*, frustrating even those who believe in it… and then someone adds a few key pages that tie some significant amount of the content together into something useful for passive visitors and *boom!* within 10 days the thing is buzzing with activity. The magnitude of the time spans varies, of course, and noone can predict what the key pages will be, either. So just hang in there and make sure to keep adding any stuff someone else might find useful. At some point, you’ll reach critical mass and the whole thing will explode."
