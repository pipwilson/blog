Anthony just asked a great question in [one of my recent blog posts](http://philwilson.org/blog/2006/09/evaluating-wikis-case-study.html "Evaluating Wikis: A Case Study"), and I thought my hasty answer was worth making into its own post (given that I’ll soon be giving [my second talk](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/wiki-workshop-2006/talks/wilson/) on this subject):

> If you’re trying to make more people use the wiki, then that’s exactly what you need to do – I’m guessing you’re in a small team, so get one other person interested and get them to start putting information on the wiki. For example, do you have a list of projects plus a description of what they are, who is on them, their status and so on? That should be on the wiki.
> 
> Are you doing any work that most people don’t know about? Like you’ve posted that Javascript code on your blog recently – put it on your wiki linked from a “code snippets” page.
> 
> Depending on your team and exactly what you do, maybe a “tips and tricks with PHP” page. Make it an internal point of reference for the rest of the developers and encourage them to add their own advice to everyone else.
> 
> The world’s your oyster in theory, but the content does need to be compelling in the first place to get people looking at it.

I do of course also maintain [a fabulous list of wiki-related resources in del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/pip/wiki) which are well worth checking out
