Yep, I did it a fortnight ago.

If you want to pick over my scripts and laugh at any security problems, just give me a shout. It does actually work rather well – we have a fifteen-working-day (aka three week) rolling backup courtesy of rsync, public-key SSH and hard links. The box that the backup sits on is shortly going to be moved to head office’s server cabinet. My script emails me daily so I can keep an eye on the disk usage and the files that have been updated – so far all is good, and we may move to a four-week backup with a DVD-backup at the end of every four weeks to go with.

I’m pleased because the system I wrote in Bash scripts is better than the purpose-built Perl monster that it replaced =)"

That worries me far too much, especially in the light of the A9 recent feature cuts.

Although on reflection, I seem to recall hearing about Microsoft using S3 for something? Ah, [here we go](http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=232)"

Surely just a matter of time before google give us all space for free 😉"

If they open up an API for that, then yep, Google Disk is here."
