I’ve not used a desktop aggregator for close to a year now, getting my information instead from these strange and archaic *webpages*, some of which are mini-aggregators like [Digg](http://www.digg.com/) or [my del.icio.us network](http://del.icio.us/network/pip).

Recently however, I’ve been slowly picking up the pace again (which means visiting more than thirty sites a day) mainly because of I’ve been reading [Planet Intertwingly](http://planet.intertwingly.net/) which seems to have a high crossoverlevel with the core of my old aggregator.

I also recently (it was now about four months ago, but it feels recent) [promised](http://philwilson.org/blog/2006/03/resources-for-writing-wxwidgets-xmpp.html "writing a WxWidgets, XMPP-aware Python aggregator") that I’d put together a cross-platform aggregator based around [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/) and [WxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/). I still want this, and made some small work towards it, putting together some integration between Planet and [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.python-hosting.com/), but it’s not really usable. I really need someone to kick my ass into getting this finished.

Also, I’m beginning to think that [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) isn’t good enough for my needs. There have certainly been times when I’ve wanted to post something but been put off by w.bloggar’s startup time. Just load and let me write my post! Sort out the connectivity later!
