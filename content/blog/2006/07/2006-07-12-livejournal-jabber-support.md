[LiveJournal have announced that they are now running an XMPP server, with users’ rosters auto-populated with their LJ friends.](http://community.livejournal.com/lj_dev/716451.html)

[Jean-Louis Seguineau wonders](http://antecipate.blogspot.com/2006/07/live-pains-on-sight.html) why there hasn’t been much coverage of this outside of the [initial announcement on LiveJournal](http://community.livejournal.com/lj_dev/716451.html). I think you have to remember that this is the release of a service rather than a product, and only pre-announcement at that. Had [SixApart](http://www.sixapart.com/) officially launched a branded Jabber client that everyone could download and get going with, I think we’d have seen a **lot** more coverage. As it is, you need to know what Jabber is, know how to get a client, configure it and then connect. Then you’ll have to run it alongside all your proprietary messengers (unless you use a native plugin-based client like [GAIM](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) or [Miranda](http://miranda-im.org)).

We may still see that large announcement, alongside full instructions on how to get going on any platform and bots for posting to your LJ, but I imagine that the initial adoption rate will be slow.

Still, what this really means is another ten million or so potential Jabber users and a lot more exposure for the technology as a whole, which can only be a good thing. It’ll be interesting to see if [SA](http://www.sixapart.com/) take this further and integrate it with any of their other business services like Movable Type, TypePad and [Vox](http://www.vox.com/).
