I’ll be getting married in a weeks’ time and we’re then headed off for fourteen days touring the fjords in Norway.

I was rather hoping that I’d be able to use [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) ahead of time to find our hotels and what was around us, and draw up a little map of where we’d be, but either Google’s location search for Norway is the pits, or the Norwegian addresses I have aren’t specific enough. Given that they do actually receive post however, I’m tempted to think it might be Google’s fault. Anyway, I’ll probably try and work with what I’ve got.

Additionally I’m semi-tempted to buy a GPS device and track some of the places we go so that when I get back I can plot that as an exciting animated treck across Norway. Yes, I’m a nerd. Welcome to my world. What this means is that I’d have to decide on and buy a device in the next couple of days – something that’s no more than £80, which is roughly what I have to spend. Maybe. I keep seeing devices that are cheaper than this, but I read further and apparently you can’t always get data off of GPS devices. How rubbish is that?

Anyway, I know practically nothing about GPS things so any advice along the lines of “X worked for me” or “Y is terrible, avoid!” in the next 48 hours will be warmly welcomed 🙂
