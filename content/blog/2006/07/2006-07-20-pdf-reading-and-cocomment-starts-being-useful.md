It’s really nice to see [Foxit PDF Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php "Foxit PDF Reader") get a bit more recognition ([this article about it](http://www.uneasysilence.com/archive/2006/07/7056/ "Foxit PDF Reader") is on front page of [Digg](http://www.digg.com/), no matter how briefly). I’ve been using it for a few years now, and there’s now way I’d move back to Adobe Reader now. It doesn’t require a proper installation – it’s just an .exe that runs. Foxit loads really quickly and I’ve never come across a PDF that it can’t read, I definitely recommend it.

In other news, [CoComment](http://www.cocomment.com/) has started being actively useful. The service only used to keep track of comments made by people with CoComment accounts but [they’ve now implemented a crawler](http://www.cocomment.com/teamblog/?p=98) which actively retrieves comments from platforms with well-known page structures. In their own words:

> If you make any comments on platforms such as WordPress, Typepad, MovableType, Blogger, Flickr, digg, Kaywa, Blogsphere, Kulando, ExpressionEngine or tblog, all subsequent comments in that comment stream will be viewable in the conversation thread on your “my conversations page” – whether they are from registered coComment users or not.

Finally! I gave up using CoComment after a few weeks when it became obvious that only other total nerds were adding any value to it, and not the people I actually wanted – people actually in the conversation. Now, using [the Firefox extension](http://www.cocomment.com/tools/extension "CoComment Firefox extension"), tracking my conversations should become totally transparent and easy! Here’s hoping!
