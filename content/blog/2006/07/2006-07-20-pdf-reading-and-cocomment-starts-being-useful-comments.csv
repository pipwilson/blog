Phil, [I’ve responded](http://www.businessblogwire.com/2006/07/what_bloggers_are_saying_about.html) to you and 21 other bloggers at my own blog. I think coComment is great, and hopefully by pooling together some of the collective feedback we’ve all got going, it’ll motivate the coCo team even more."

So far, even thought it’s early days, coComment is looking much improved and far more useful now than it was before.

In fairness, I’ve not tried co.mments, but there doesn’t seem to be a Firefox extension which automatically picks these things up, which is the killer feature for me."
