Bristol City Council [has joined the ODF Alliance](http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=26A545A9-8BC5-41F5-813B-9448B16F5980), furthering the city’s work as a member of the Government’s [Open Source Academy](http://www.opensourceacademy.gov.uk/).

The Council already uses StarOffice instead of Microsoft Office internally, and has provided [a number of documents and training materials](http://www.opensourceacademy.gov.uk/osacademy/our_partners/bristol-city-council/bristol-city-council "Bristol City Council open source training materials") for other councils to use when assessing whether to make the switch themselves.
