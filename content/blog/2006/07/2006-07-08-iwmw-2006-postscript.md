I gave two seminar talks at [IWMW 2006](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/ "Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006"), ‚ÄúSharing and Exploring Team Knowledge with Wikis‚Äù and ‚ÄúExposing yourself on the web with microformats!‚Äù (slides for both to come).

These were my first time doing any kind of public speaking since I left school, so I managed to lever-in some internal presentations on how to use wikis in the previous week which were a great intro on what not to do üòâ

The IWMW wikis talk seemed to go really really well with lots of questions from the audience, and some good feedback afterwards. The Microformats talk was, er, less successful ‚Äì mainly due to me turning up to it twenty minutes late due to a mix-up over the starting time (not all my fault!) during which [Brian Kelly](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/b.kelly/ "Brian Kelly") manfully held the fort ‚Äì but I think I still got across some of the more important points Both talks covered how the attendees could take these technologies back to their universities and start using them straight away.

Taking a look at the [](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/timetable/ "<font size=3>Institutional Web Management Workshop 2006: Quality MattersWorkshop Timetable</font>‚Äú>event schedule</a> is a really good round-up of where the IT departments of UK universities are at the moment (among other things, worrying about Web 2.oh and if/how they should be able to integrate its principles, just like any other enterprise IT department).</p>
