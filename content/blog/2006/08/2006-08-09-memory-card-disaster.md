I’m still on honeymoon in Norway (and very nice it is too – the wife, as well as Norway ;), at a quick terminal to see if I can collect some advice.

Shortly before we left, I bought a new 1GB memory stick pro card for my ailing Sony DSC-P72 (I think that’s the model off the top of my head) – it’s just lost 112 photos from the middle of my honeymoon, and I want them back.

When inserted into the camera and into a port on a PC the card registers 190MB worth of photos, but c.360MB used space. The difference is what I guess the space my missing photos should take is and so I suspect that the data which makes them up, at least, is still on the memory stick. There’s nothing else on the stick which would account for this space. I’m on a Norwegian copy of Windows, so I don’t want to push my exploring too far in case I click “Ja” on the wrong box 🙂

The question now is, what do I do? What tool can I use or who can I take it to in order to recover this data? There’s obvious sentimental attachment, but I don’t really want to pay data recovery service-level charges just for some photos. On the other hand, I **\*do\*** want them back.

Any ideas or suggestions would be most welcome. I’ll be back in the UK sometime around the 20th August, so I’ll give an update shortly after then.
