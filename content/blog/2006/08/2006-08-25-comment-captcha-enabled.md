With great reluctance I am temporarily enabling captchas for comments.

Although it’s normally excellent at blocking spam comments, Blogger has let 300 spam comments through to [this post](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/10/amazon-adds-ajax-magic.html) in the past two weeks or so, and I’m running out of time to keep deleting them.

I will try to remember to disable the captcha in a months’ time to see how things are going
