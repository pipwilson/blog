A few hours after spotting nintendo.co.uk using it, I see the BBC has switched to using the common feed icon. Not only that, but they’ve rewritten their [introduction to RSS](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/3223484.stm), replacing the acronym “RSS” with the word “feed” and using newer screenshots showing the feed icon.

To me this makes sense (and hopefully will push along our switch to it at work), although I’m not sure how clear it is to Joe Pleb right now. Maybe after IE7 is shoved down our throats it’ll make more sense.
