I’ve used this to retrieve files after my card ended up blank. Most of the pictures came out perfect, a couple had a bit of corruption on them."

Andy – thank you! Obviously I stopped using the card as soon as I realised what had happened, and I’ve now been able to retrieve all but ten photos which I thought were lost, and which cover some of the best parts of our honeymoon. Thank you so much! If you’re ever around in the south-west of the UK, then I owe you a drink or five 🙂"
