perhaps you remember me. a fairly long time ago i wrote a php script that converts the xml generated by your script to a clear listing.

Are there some news about your history export script? I read that it doesn’t work with the new Firefox versions … did you enhance it already?

ps: i took the liberty of adding your excellent blog to my blogrole on <http://www.kortas.net> (only in german … sorry for that)

greetings from germany

I haven’t updated the script because Firefox 2.0 uses SQLite instead of an RDF backend, so it needs to be totally rewritten.

I will look at rewriting it when the stable version of Firefox 2.0 is released.

i heard some rumours of placing the history-data in a new way instead of that freaky fileformat but i dont know that this will happen in firefox 2.0.

well, i am looking forward to your new and updated script. if the data your script returns is an xml-file again i will write a script too 😀"
