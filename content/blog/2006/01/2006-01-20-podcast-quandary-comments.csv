Having said that, there doesn’t seem to be much of downloading in the background and is a bit poor generally IMHO. Also ducks out the centrally managed subscription list.

Cheers for the pointers to the podcasts though 🙂"

They have this thing called “feedStation” which detects embeded audio. When you click on it, it automatically loads it to an app called feedStation where it is available for playback without a browser whenever you want.

I use iTunes myself, so I don’t use the feedstation, but as far as I can tell, this is exactly the kind of thing you are looking for."

I might investigate the Playr option, but I really would like the files on disk.

I’m still on Winamp 5.01 so I’ll upgrade to 5.1 and check out the new podcast features (caveats noted!) , cheers for that Rob.

Newsgator, pfah. I want to control my own data thank you very much 🙂"
