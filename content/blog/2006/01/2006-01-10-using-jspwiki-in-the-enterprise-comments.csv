Unfortunately, they were also traditional, and made me lock down EVERY page. Not really in the spirit of collaboration methinks.

I’m using an old alpha, I tried to upgrade to the latest version (3 times actually) but that just ended up with late nights rolling back."

Sad to hear about the page lockdown, like you say, it’s kind of contrary to the entire point of wikis 🙂

Oh, and ha, that’s what you get for deploying an alpha 🙂"
