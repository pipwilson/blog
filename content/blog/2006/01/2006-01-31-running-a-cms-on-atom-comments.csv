You could use some sort of permanent unique identifier for the term, and just let users edit the label.

A possible implementation would be to store categories as entries filed in category Category, which is identified by a predefined term. The ID of such a category entry would then serve as the category term and its title would provide the human-readable category label. The summary/content of such a category entry could be used for a description of the category. Such a category would not manifest as a page on the site if you don’t want to make one; remember that an entry need not have an *alternate* link."
