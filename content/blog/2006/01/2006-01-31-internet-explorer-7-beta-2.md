IE7 beta 2 is out, and all the MS bloggers are pimping it, so I thought I’d actually check out the site (I might install it at work, but there’s no chance I’m installing it at home).

So you visit the [IE7 homepage](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx) and you’re greeted by a terrible mid-1990s flash animation touting IE’s new features, all of which sound quite remarkably similar to features everyone who uses Firefox and Opera has been using for a few years now. Finally, you’ll realise that this isn’t actually a splash page that is going to forward to actual content, but the scrolling words are clickable items and then when you scroll down (my monitor’s currently at 1024×768, I have two large-ish toolbars and the navigation menu for the page isn’t visible in Firefox *or* IE6 – didn’t we solve scalable Flash about seven years ago?) you’ll find the actual navigation, from where you can get to the tour.

I was actually looking forward to the tour, I ignored the first IE7 beta because it was bound to be terrible, but now I’m keen to see the new cutting-edge features:

<q>Tabbed browsing! Streamlined user interface!</q>

Oh dear.

<q>Instant RSS feed detection! Toolbar search box!</q>

Oh deary dear.

Unless they’ve got something *spectacular* to pull out of the hat, I think I pity the IE7 developers. I mean, they’ve been working for a good couple of years now, and they’re just approaching Opera and Firefox’s heels? I haven’t seen much of the Internet’s response, but I think they’re going to be ripped apart for this. I initially took Rod Begbie’s comment with a pinch of salt, but it’s dead on:

> Microsoft have released a public beta of IE7. The homepage is a staggeringly fucking awful flash animation, promising “Everything you need, nothing you don’t, and a few things you have yet to imagine”, before displaying a list of Firefox’s features.
