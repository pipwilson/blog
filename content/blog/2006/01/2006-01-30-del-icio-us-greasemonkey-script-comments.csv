And if there’s a hard limit on the form inputs, this is impossible.

Instead, you want to give the user a counter telling them how many bytes the currently entered content is long. If you’re so inclined, add some additional visual cue like turning the text or a label red or something.

Note that I purposely talked about *bytes* here: del.icio.us cuts off at 255 bytes, but uses UTF-8, so 255 bytes &lt; 255 characters if your description contains any character outside of US-ASCII."

After I’d done it, I did actually think about not limiting the text field, and turning it red if you had over 255 characters – I hadn’t realised they limit to 255 *bytes*, that’s interesting, I’ve never had to count bytes in JavaScript before."
