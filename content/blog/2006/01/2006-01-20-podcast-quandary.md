I like the idea of podcasts. There are some I even subscribe to: [LugRadio](http://www.lugradio.org/ "LugRadio"), [Ricky Gervais](http://www.guardian.co.uk/rickygervais "Ricky Gervais on the Guardian"), [Mark Kermode’s film reviews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/entertainment/kermode.shtml) and now [Channel 4 have their own podcast](http://www.channel4.com/news/podcasts/index.html "Jon Snow is da man!") which allows you to listen to “Jon Snow’s specially commissioned radio programme” ([via Fintan](http://www.dech.co.uk/2006/01/new-channel-4-news-podcast-with-additional-content/)).

The problem is, I use a web-based feed reader, but I want podcast mp3s on my local machine, whichever one that might be. I suppose I could auto-download them to my web host and then use something like the del.icio.us [play tagger](http://del.icio.us/help/playtagger "Play Tagger streams mp3s over the web") to stream them back, but I don’t always have my browser open (although I do most of the time, it has to be said), and I don’t want to keep a tab or window open just for mp3 playback when I already have Winamp, which minimises away to the tray thank you very much.

Maybe the key is to also have a desktop aggregator which queries my web-based aggregator about podcast feeds I’m subscribed to (or feeds which use enclosures in general), so that it can download them in the background, and it’s just ready to go? That sounds like it might be a good solution, and I think it would be reasonably straightforward. Any other ideas?
