Gmail has rolled out [a delete button](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=32608&hl=en), so that users can now easily delete their mail instead of just archiving it (because despite what some people think, you *could* actually delete your mail before via the drop-down box of actions).

This has come after a pretty long period of complaining by Gmail users, and [the addition has been widely heralded as a good one](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/its-in-mail.html#links). I have one message to those people: you don’t understand Gmail.

Honestly, if you think you *needed* a “delete” button (or were using [the Greasemonkey extension](http://www.arantius.com/article/arantius/gmail%20delete%20button/)), you’ve completely misunderstood not only the Gmail interface but also the new experience the team has tried to give you. No exceptions. If you disagree with this, and also think that, like [someone in the betanews comments](http://www.betanews.com/article/Gmail_Gives_Up_Adds_Delete_Button/1137780109), <q>Now If they will get rid of the Archive thing and star thing for something better it would be even better</q>, you should stop using Gmail for web-based mail. Seriously. Or if you do want to keep using it because of the 2GB space, start using a desktop POP client like [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/). That way you’ll be completely immured from what Google are trying to do, and you can go back to your 1995 interface.

If this isn’t obviously apparent to you, just take a moment to actually read [that part of the Gmail help explaining delete](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=32608&hl=en). For a start, it’s called “I’m not sure if I should archive or delete” – bingo. Such equivocation is totally unnecessary for all except the most pedantically set-in-their-ways; “archive” is enough. The text of the help even goes on to encourage you to use “archive” rather than “delete”.

I feel so, so sorry for Gmail’s developers.
