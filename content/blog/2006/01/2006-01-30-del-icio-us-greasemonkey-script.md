A couple of weeks ago, [Tom Coates was moaning](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/01/a_delicious_design_gripe.shtml "A del.icio.us design gripe...") about a UI aspect of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us):

> I *do not understand* why del.icio.us’ submission form doesn’t limit the amount of characters that you can input into it. Instead, you’re left to work out later that whatever you’d written had been cut off automatically at a couple of hundred characters to fit into the database. This must be the simplest thing to fix, surely?

Actually, yes, it is. Here’s [a Greasemonkey script which limits the description field to 255 characters](http://philwilson.org/code/greasemonkey/deliciousdescription.user.js "del.icio.us description") and displays a character counter after the text box so you can see how many you’ve got left when adding a pithy comment.

Install [del.icio.us description](http://philwilson.org/code/greasemonkey/deliciousdescription.user.js)
