Thanks for your comments and questions about Tello. Since SIP/SIMPLE supports both telephony and presence, it is a logical thing to combine them as we have done at Tello. Tello actually uses both SIP/SIMPLE and XMPP in our service, and we plan to offer gateway services as part of our federation. We believe that presence will play a central role in business communications and processes in the future."

Thanks very much for this feedback. Tello’s itententions to offer gateway services are extremely interesting, as is your usage of XMPP.

Obviously had I found <http://www.tello.com/connect.html> and <http://www.tello.com/federation.html> earlier, I would have known this already, but your site is a little hard-going on the casual visitor’s eyes. Good content, but perhaps a little much of it in too small a font in places?

I agree and think that presence will clearly play a huge role in the day to day operations of not only business but in all social interactions."
