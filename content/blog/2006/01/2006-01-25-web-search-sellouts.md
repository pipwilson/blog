So, [Googleâ€™s censoring its results in China](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4647398.stm), [Yahoo helps get Chinese bloggers arrested](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4221538.stm) and Microsoft [censors](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4088702.stm) and [removes Chinese bloggers from its system](http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2006/01/microsoft_takes.html).
