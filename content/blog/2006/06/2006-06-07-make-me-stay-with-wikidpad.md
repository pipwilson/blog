I drop in and out of using WikidPad. I’ve just picked it up again after a lengthy absence.

What would make me adopt it full time? Some extension ideas from the top of my head:

- an RSS aggregator (a new “Feeds” tree maybe)
- Trac integration (the WikidPad website is powered by Trac, so this would be nice, and we use it at work) – this could be a new item in “Views” where you can see “Project” then drill into milestones and see tickets etc.
- “Blog this page” which takes the rendered HTML and bungs it off at an endpoint
- or more generically perhaps, make it an Atom Publishing Protocol client
