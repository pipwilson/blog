I still havenâ€™t written up my notes from presenting at [IWMW2006](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2006/) last week, but today Iâ€™m jetting off to Dublin for [Apachecon 2006](http://www.eu.apachecon.com/). I may try and keep a vaguely up-to-date blog on the event, so expect some tedious posts over the next week ðŸ™‚
