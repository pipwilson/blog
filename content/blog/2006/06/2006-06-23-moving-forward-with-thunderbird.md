Although I’ve been using Thunderbird at work now for almost a year, the only extension I’ve had installed has been [Lightning](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:Lightning) to display my work calendar.

Yesterday that changed, and I’m really glad. I’ve installed a few excellent extensions:

[Quote Colurs](http://quotecolors.mozdev.org/) adds inline colouring to nested replies. I didn’t think this would make much difference, but it’s suddenly made mailing lists a joy.

[QuickMenu MC](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon.php?id=1624) adds the folders you most frequently move mails directly under the “Move To” menu (so that you don’t have to navigate four or more menus down)

[GmailUI](http://www.longshot.com/~kmixter/gmailui.html) adds a new option to the search box allowing GMail-like search syntax such as “from:andy” “to:phil” and so on. This is now essential to me – I use GMail all the time at home, and I’ve been constantly typing GMail-syntax searches into the Thunderbird search box in vain til now.

[Thunderbird Header Tools](http://www.supportware.net/mozilla/#ext15) allows you to change the headers of emails (I use this for editing subject lines to reflect the action I have to take on the mail) and add new headers; built-in is the ability to add X-Tags and X-Categories, which you can then create Smart Folders for, so that you can effectively tag mails and have them appear in certain folders automatically. Genius!

[Thunderbird QuickMove](http://www.supportware.net/mozilla/#ext19) assigns a shortcut key-combo to moving mails to certain folders. CTRL+1 now moves mails from my Inbox to my “Archive” folder. So now I can move mails quickly either by keyboard, or by mouse (via QuickMenu MC, above).
