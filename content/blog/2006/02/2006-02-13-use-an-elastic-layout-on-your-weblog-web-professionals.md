I’ve had a couple of several-hundred-word posts hanging around on this topic for months now, but my frustration has finally got to the point where the technical stuff can wait – if you have a weblog which has centred text (even [Hivelogic](http://hivelogic.com/) and [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/) fall foul of this) then **make your contents elastic!**

When I **increase the font size** of my browser, I don’t want to be seeing **6 words per line** when there’s **masses of whitespace to either side of the content container**! I want that content container to be the **main focus of the page**! I want it to **expand with the font**! I don’t want the page to become *less legible* when I make the font bigger! This is not a swings and roundabouts exercise! Sort it out! Roger Johansson gets it right on [456 Berea Street](http://www.456bereastreet.com/), and you call yourselves web professionals – sort it out!
