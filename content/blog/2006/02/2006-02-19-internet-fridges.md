I was reading the other day about how futurologists get it wrong and how we’re never going to see an Internet Fridge. Well goddamn if I don’t want some variation on that.

How much would I give for the ability to scan the barcodes of stuff I put in my cupboards and fridge, then scan it again when I remove it, and so be able to call up the list of what’s currently in my kitchen when I’m at the supermarket, or have it automatically remind me when I’m out of something, or running out, or, from a pre-defined list, auto-create most of my shopping list. I mean, how hard can that be? The hardest bit (by a country mile) is getting the barcode scanner to understand what item you’re swiping in front of it, the rest is “just” programming (and let’s face it, if I can do it, it can’t be hard).
