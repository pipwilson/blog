Their other products (CaliberRM, StarTeam, Borland Together) are damn good and they have good integration with Eclipse / VS, as well as the Mercury toolset. In terms of requirements, config mgmt, UML they are going strong.

They also just purchased a project management solutions company and are releasing ‘tempo’ at some point that covers this.

In the overall application lifecycle (I.e. not IDEs)- Borland are WAY ahead of their competitors and lots of big organisations are buying into them."
