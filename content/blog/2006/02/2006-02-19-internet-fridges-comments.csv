You shouldn’t need to go out of your way to run items past a scanner. ‘course you’d have to hook your kitchen computer up to the market computer or change the current spec on rfids (to id classes instead of instances)."

hey leff, you apparently know a lot more about RFID than I do. Although, in our kitchen, we collect the empty jars for recycling very close to the cupboard so that might be a problem."

In order to have an internet fridge it means you need a PDA or similar to communicate with it at the supermarket.

Maybe you could just install a roving webcam in your fridge, that way you could look at what’s in the fridge while you’re at the supermarket – thus saving tedious employment of barcode scanners and intrusive RFID technology."
