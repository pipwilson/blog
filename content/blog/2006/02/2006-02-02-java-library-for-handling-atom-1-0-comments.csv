We’re not the first, but AFAIK we’re the most active… and Atom 1.0 support is a big differentiator at the moment.

Have fun with ROME, and if you get stuck, don’t hesitate to join the mailing lists and ask for help.

Regards,   
 Mark"

It says a lot for the ease of use that I was able to get started reading, parsing and creating Atom 1.0 feeds with a pre-0.8 CVS version of ROME, without any documentation.

There are a couple of nicities I’d like to see, but what’s already there is great!"
