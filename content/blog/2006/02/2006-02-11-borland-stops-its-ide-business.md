[Borland plans separate company for Delphi, JBuilder, C++Builder, InterBase, JDataStore and other developer products…](http://blogs.borland.com/davidi/archive/2006/02/08/23013.aspx)

I always wondered how Borland were making money from their IDEs given such strong competition in the Java and .NET markets, and of course Delphi has only ever been a minor player, it turns out that they were wondering the same thing.

I actually feel quite sad – we were taught programming using Delphi at University, and JBuilder was my first Java IDE. Years later, I was using C++Builder now and again, and I was using [Kylix](http://shop.borland.com/dr/sat4/ec_Main.Entry17C?SID=39696&SP=10023&CID=0&PID=750285&PN=1&V1=750285&CUR=840&DSP=&PGRP=0&ABCODE=&CACHE_ID=0) to develop cross-platform native applications. No longer.

It’s always a shame to see a competitor in a largely unchallenged marketplace (namely the .NET IDE market) drop out, and I imagine that for most developers, this will be the last time they hear the Borland name.
