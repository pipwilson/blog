Uche Ogbuji wrote [a](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-06-27/Wow___XML_) [bunch](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-11-14/I_already_) [of](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-11-15/I_must_be_) [entries](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-11-16/Does_it_co) [on](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-12-02/XML_Bookma) [that](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-12-05/XSLT_for_c); we discussed the option of using Atom as well, but rejected it because of *atom:updated* and the lack of a way to represent a hierarchical folder structure directly in the markup.

One thing XBEL has in common with the other options you explored is that it already has some implementations – a number of browsers –, but support is far from ubiquitous."
793,2006-02-22T09:16:00+00:00,Aristotle,,,comment,0,"PS.: there’s no reason you can’t just used the current datetime as the value of *atom:updated* elements. Such an element is metadata about the entry in the feed but not necessarily about the alternate representation it points to."
794,2006-02-22T11:07:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Yes, I knew about XBEL, and had read Uche’s posts and the following comments, but quite frankly, the last thing I wanted to do was start generating a format that in reality no-one is ever likely to use for this kind of thing.

(and yes, my updated element is in fact just the timestamp for the export, and not the atual last updated timestamp for the feed, but doing that feels rather horrible – I do feel that if I’m describing a feed, I should probably be providing the last time *it* updated.

Kevin, whilst Technorati Favourites should import my XOXO, I have no idea how exactly I’m supposed to specify it. It certainly fails to import the file I link to in my main post."
795,2006-02-23T15:12:00+00:00,l.m.orchard,,,comment,0,"For what it’s worth, Technorati Favorites seemed to enjoy [my XOXO output](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/23/opml-to-xoxo-to-technorati-favorites-2). But, I’m not entirely sure what the significant difference is between [yours](http://philwilson.org/feeds/subscriptions-xoxo.xml) and [mine](http://decafbad.com/2006/02/subs-amusements.xoxo). In fact, yours would seem to be the better constructed XOXO, with more semantic cues."
796,2006-02-24T12:27:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"That’s interesting Les. Mine is a closer mapping of what you’d expect from Atom maybe.

I was going to try adding class=”feed” to each of the feed links, but Technorati appear to have updated their import script so that mine works now. Nice!"
