[Opera have announced that they’re going to release a browser for the DS in Japan.](http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/02/15/)

Frankly, this is brilliant. The browser on the PSP is all very well  
and good, but it’s nowhere near the ease of navigation that a  
touchscreen will give. The amount of time I end up waiting at train  
stations with free DS-enabled WiFi will make this brilliant (although  
the fact that it’s going to be about twenty quid does suck). Suddenly  
web services like [meebo](http://www.meebo.com/ "Online instant messaging") become much more appealing.

See [Russ Beattie’s review of Opera Mobile](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008770.html), and [CVG’s article](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php?id=134275). In related news, [this is the best picture I’ve seen comparing the old Nintendo DS with the DS lite](http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20060215/nin10.jpg).
