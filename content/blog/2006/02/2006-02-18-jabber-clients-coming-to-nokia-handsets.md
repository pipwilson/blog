Well, not quite yet, but soon anyway.

Through a chat with [Ralph Meijer](http://ralphm.net/blog/), and an email to [Joe Hildebrand](http://arch.jabber.com/weblog/), I got in touch with Shawn Carrigan from [Jabber Inc.](http://www.jabber.com/) who sent me a pre-release version of their Symbian Jabber client. and very good it is too. Fast, intuitive and usable.

Orange France rolled a version of this out late last year, and Iâ€™m  
led to believe that they will be rolling this client out across the UK  
and the Netherlands in Spring sometime, although their PR department  
didnâ€™t return my emails.

It has all the features that you would expect including chat, status  
messages, sorting users into groups, user blocking, emoticons, message  
templates, playing a sound on new message receipt, profile editing and  
so on.

The best thing is that itâ€™s not locked to a particular server, so  
you can connect to your favourite XMPP server, including Google Talk.

Jabber Inc. are clearly committed to supporting the XMPP standards as a version which will be released soon will support [JEP-65 (SOCKS5 Bytestreams)](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0065.html) via multimedia messaging and [JEP-45 (Multi-user Chat)](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0045.html) via simple MUC.

I know that [Jim Hughes](http://feetup.org/blog/ "Jim Hughes' weblog") has also got a copy, so he may also write something interesting about it. Keep your eyes peeled ðŸ™‚
