Ben Hammersley now [uses iWeb for publishing](http://www.benhammersley.com/FCE47259-78BA-4B5E-ABF2-F39B93520C85/Blog/16F11A70-848F-4143-A814-36DAA6CDAAB9.html) and claims that [this is better for his readers.](http://www.benhammersley.com/FCE47259-78BA-4B5E-ABF2-F39B93520C85/Blog/8A127A89-AAD2-4243-8E11-0BDE85AB5394.html)

[Aristotle says it well](http://plasmasturm.org/log/397/):

> Why not publish in PDF if you’re going to go against the web’s grain anyway? That gets you frictionless publishing tools.

Also see [Gareth’s Textify! Greasemonkey script](http://xurble.org/weblog/2006/02/textify.html) which restores the content to actual text rather than an embedded image. Nice way to really show how much you hate the web, Hammersley!
