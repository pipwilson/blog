Not that PalmSource aren’t entirely dead anyway, but they recently announced a “commercial-grade Linux-based platform designed for smartphones and mobile devices” called the ACCESS Linux Platform (ACCESS being the Japanese firm which bought PalmSource in December 05).

The interesting highlights are:

- using SQLlite for data storage, which should make 3rd party integration easy
- using GTK+ for the UI (just like [Nokia with Maemo](http://maemo.org/))

I don’t think I can even remember the last time I saw a Palm-powered device (other than my unused Clié, under my desk).
