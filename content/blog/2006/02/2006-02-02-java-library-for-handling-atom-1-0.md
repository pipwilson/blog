[Rome](https://rome.dev.java.net/) 0.8 came out this morning, and now has support for Atom 1.0, rather timely given [my current work](http://philwilson.org/blog/2006/01/running-cms-on-atom.html)! You can download it from [the Rome releases page](https://rome.dev.java.net/source/browse/rome/www/dist/).

As far as Iâ€™m aware, this is the first Java library for creating and reading Atom 1.0 feeds, and very easy to use it is too.
