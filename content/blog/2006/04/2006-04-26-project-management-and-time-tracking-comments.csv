I’d only thought about one Trac instance per person for non-project time.

Hmm, your idea could work you know."

This isn’t quite ready yet, but the [first implementation](http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/how-openpsa-uses-dbe.html) is promising.

The good part about this is that if different orgs participate in the same Trac-managed development project, each can get their tasks to their own project management software. Assuming it supports DBE, of course 🙂"
