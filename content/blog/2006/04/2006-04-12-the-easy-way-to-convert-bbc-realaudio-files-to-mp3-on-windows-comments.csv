Which, of course, if you find the software useful, you should do!"

i am just a new to the blog, so i am not familiar with some rules, i just think you can tell me, but not remove my comment, so crude."
843,2006-07-01T19:34:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Actually, I know him in real life, so I know he doesn’t. Also, his post wasn’t simply an advert for a website (regardless of who owns it), it was a link to a direct download of the file I was talking about in my post.

I routinely delete comments which look like they are just adverts for websites added by spam robots, and I’m afraid to say that yours looked like one.

Had you instead maybe linked to a blog post you had written about the same piece of software, or linked to a blog post which had a link to a piece of software which did the same thing as my post is talking about, I would have left your comment."

\#!/bin/bash  
\# catchbreezeblock – capture “Radio1 Breezeblock”   
\# copy this file to your home area and   
\# chmod u+x thisfilename  
\# then run it by:  
\# ./thisfilename

\# Just use todays date in the filename  
DATE=`date +%F` # Save the date as YYYY-MM-DD

\# Where to save it – the Breezeblock became the “Radio 1 Experimental” in October 2006  
FILE=/tmp/music/breezeblock.$DATE.ogg   
\#STREAM=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/shows/rpms/radio1/breezeblock.rpm  
STREAM=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/shows/rpms/radio1/hobbs.rpm

\# tags for the OGG Vorbis file   
AUTHOR=”Mary Ann Hobbs”  
ALBUM=”Radio 1″  
TITLE=”Breezeblock – $DATE”

\# Use mplayer to capture the stream $STREAM to the file $FILE  
/usr/bin/mplayer -really-quiet -cache 500 -ao pcm:file=”$FILE.wav” -playlist “$STREAM”

\# Encode to .ogg, quality 2, and tag the file  
echo OggEnc $TITLE, $AUTHOR, $ALBUM  
oggenc -q 2 -t “$TITLE” -a “$AUTHOR” -l “$ALBUM” -n “1/1” -G “Radio” -R 48000 -o “$FILE” “$FILE.wav”

\# Remove the raw audio data file  
echo Cleaning up  
rm “$FILE.wav”"

847,2007-02-21T12:23:00+00:00,"Phil Wilson",,,comment,0,"Net Transport you mean?

I think the BBC recently changed how their files work so you’ll need to download the .ram file, open it up in notepad and copy/paste the URL of the .rm file into Net Transport instead.

It’s a pain in the bum, I know."
