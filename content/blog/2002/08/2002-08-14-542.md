So, now I’ve refound the source I started months ago, I’ve started XurbleZilla, which is a Mozilla-based client for [xurble](http://www.xurble.org), an open source java-based bulletin board/instant messenger thing.

It’s intended to finally be a sidebar application using Mozilla’s native widgets (XUL), installable from the web, so you can use xurble whilst browsing, etc.

It’s not up yet, but there \_will\_ be a xurblezilla webpage.

hooray me.
