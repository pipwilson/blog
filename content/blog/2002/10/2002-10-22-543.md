There’s also been a lot of fuss in the last few days about Mitch Kapor’s “[outlook killer](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/20/1827210)” and the [Open Source Application Foundation](http://www.osafoundation.org). But in all honestly, there doesn’t seem to be anything really new, either in terms of philosophy or software (vaporware?). The net community just \_loves\_ latching onto all and sundry projects which promise something new, sometimes taking weeks before we can see if it’s any good, important, or in fact possible at all. In fact the best web revolutions tend to be the quiet ones.
