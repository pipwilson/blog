I really like blue, and thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s lots of it on this site, and not much else. Thereâ€™s also no content, but shhhh and no-one will notice.

Iâ€™m in the middle of my University finals, with two more to go before I can finally leave Reading and get to live with my utterly wonderful girlfriend in Sheffield.

Itâ€™s been a swine of a year, although Iâ€™ve learnt loads and loads (mostly in my free time in case you thought I learnt anything at Uni ;), which should come in handy whilst Iâ€™m trying to get a job.

My cool co-host and housemate Josh is off back to Holland tomorrow, and Iâ€™ll be losing net access until I get to my girlfriendâ€™s (a 2GHz PC! woo!), so I just thought Iâ€™d write something before it went. ðŸ™‚

Wishing me lots of luck for all my examsâ€¦â€¦..me.
