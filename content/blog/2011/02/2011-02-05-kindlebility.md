In my attempts to find better ways of getting long-form content onto my Kindle to read offline, I’ve mainly been using two tools: [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and [the Later On Kindle Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ncpgbjikhdoedlilphcppnglbipboglf).

Instapaper has great formatting, and repeated delivery works like a new issue of a periodical, but as far as I can tell, on a slightly unpredictable schedule (or at least on a schedule that is slightly inconvenient to me).

Later on Kindle sends the content pretty much instantly, which is much more useful since it means that provided I leave a few minutes to make sure it all gets processed, I can send some pages just before I leave work, and read them on the way home! The big downside is that your page ends up text-only; it doesn’t keep images in the same way that Instapaper does. Also, having it in the Chrome toolbar is very nice.

The solution for me is [**Kindlebility**](http://kindlebility.darkhax.com/). It uses [Readability](http://readability.com) to parse the page into a sensible layout (including multi-page articles), converts that to a PDF, then emails the result to your Kindle. It’s triggered by a bookmarklet, which means it can be added to any browser. Even better, [it’s open source](https://github.com/darkhelmet/kindlebility) (more info [in this blog post](http://blog.darkhax.com/2011/01/20/the-what-why-and-how-of-kindlebility)), which means that if I want to, I can avoid using any middleman at all!

Right now, this is by far the best solution I’ve come across so big thanks to Daniel Huckstep for putting it together!
