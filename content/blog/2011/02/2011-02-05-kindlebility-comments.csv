I keep on reading good reviews on Kindlebility, but it doesn’t seem to work for me (or it would really take ages for it to get past the first page…).  
Anyway, it is possible to send your Instapaper compilation to Kindle right away, whenever you want to, so what’s the point in pdf conversion? (Just asking, maybe I’m missing something.)"

Instapaper is two-step if you want the page on your Kindle immediately, Kindlebility is one-step. That is a compelling reason for me. The Instapaper auto-delivery has not seemed totally reliable in my experience, and delivers at an odd time of day for those of us on GMT. Also, it means you’re dependent on a closed-source, third party application (you can run your own Kindlebility if you’re that way inclined)."

But still, I can’t make it work. Email added to whitelist, address double-checked, not sure what else is to be configured… Instapaper, klip.me etc. works fine, so I’m clueless."
