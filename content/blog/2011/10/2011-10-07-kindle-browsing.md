The [Kindle Touch 3G](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Touch-e-Reader-Touch-Screen-3G-Special-Offers/dp/B005890G8O) is the only new Kindle with 3G available and you [won’t be able to access anything except the Kindle Store and Wikipedia with it](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/10/kindle-touch-3g-cant-access-most-of-internet-without-wifi.arshttp://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/10/kindle-touch-3g-cant-access-most-of-internet-without-wifi.ars).

My Kindle Keyboard has 3G and I’ve used it, in the case of flat-phone-battery-syndrome, when out and about, to send emails to my family to let them know where I am, that I’m goin to be late, and more. I’ve used it to go on Facebook, and to read Hacker News (via <http://ihackernews.com/>). I think that yes, OK, it’s a shame that the absence of wikitravel means that [this xkcd is no longer accurate](http://xkcd.com/548/), but the loss is greater than that – having such a cheap device with unfettered access to the internet is A Good Thing – I guess Amazon decided the bills just weren’t worth it.
