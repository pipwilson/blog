The practical stuff first.

In February 2009, [inspired by Pete Prodoehl](http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/12/20/delisync-for-scuttle/), I set up my own version of [scuttle](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scuttle/), an open source del.icio.us clone, and hacked it to auto-post my bookmarks to my del.icio.us account using [the php-delicious library](http://www.ejeliot.com/pages/php-delicious).

I have finally [pushed this to github](http://github.com/pipwilson/scuttle). My change is literally [about ten lines of code](https://github.com/pipwilson/scuttle/blob/master/services/deliciousservice.php), although as [my delicious account](http://delicious.com/pip) testifies, it has bugs that I havenâ€™t been bothered to fix. It is currently version 0.7.4 of scuttle, and I plan on merging it to the latest 0.9 in a day or two.

Update: actually it looks like I set this up in 2006, way before I remember!
