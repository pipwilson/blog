Nathan and Tim both made a sensible comment on my “[Readme](http://philwilson.org/blog/2010/09/readme/)” post – [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) supports daily delivery of unread articles directly to a kindle – use that!

This is a great idea; I’ve started using it and it works very well.

But this means that I’m using Google Reader to do my aggregation, and then when an article is too long to read right then, scrolling back to the top of it, opening it in a new tab, hitting the Instapaper bookmarklet, and letting it do its thing.

I already star articles in Google Reader that I want to read later (by pressing ‘s’). When I meet something on the wider web that I want to mark to read later, I add it to my scuttle install, and tag it with “readme”. This is two lists of “read me later” content.

So I want two things:

1. [When I star an item](http://blog.martindoms.com/2009/10/16/using-the-google-reader-api-part-2/#starred) in google reader, it gets automatically added to scuttle tagged “readme”
2. Items tagged with “readme” in scuttle are automatically added to Instapaper [via their API](http://www.instapaper.com/api)

In fact, I really want more than this – I want to use [a port of Arc90’s Readability](http://www.keyvan.net/2010/08/php-readability/) (there are many, in many different languages) to grab the content from the page I’ve tagged, and then every day generate my own .mobi file and email it to my kindle – basically, take the instapaper bit out of the equation. However, other than calling out to [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621), I can’t see a way of generating a .mobi file at all. Any pointers would be very welcome!
