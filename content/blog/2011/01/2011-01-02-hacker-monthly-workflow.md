I got a Kindle for Christmas, and I subscribe to [Hacker Monthly](http://hackermonthly.com/). HM is provided in PDF, epub and .mobi – the Kindle can read .mobi file natively, so when the latest HM arrived today I was keen to try it out.

A link to the latest download is delivered by email, so the normal workflow for viewing the PDF is like this:

1. receive email
2. click link to PDF
3. file downloads and PDF reader opens

For the kindle it appears to be this:

1. receive email
2. click link to .mobi
3. file downloads
4. compose new email to my @free.kindle.com address
5. attach downloaded .mobi file
6. send
7. wait for it to arrive on the kindle (a minute or so)

I could simply connect the Kindle to a computer and transfer the file over USB, but that kind of defeats the point doesn’t it?

I had been hoping to just be able to load my email in the browser on the Kindle and click the link from there, but unfortunately I use GMail which opens links in new tabs, which the Kindle browser doesn’t support (even in mobile GMail, which is what I’m actually using on the Kindle).

Are there better options that I’m missing?
