GMail does seem to use hyperlinks rather than JS high-jinks for attachments, so you should be able to cut/paste the attachment URL to download in the same window."

I’m Cheng Soon, the Hacker Monthly guy. I could tweak our subscription management system so you could directly receive the MOBI as attachment on your kindle address. However, I will need somebody to test it before rolling it out to all customers (Kindle doesn’t ship to Malaysia). If you’re interested, could you drop me an email? cheng dot soon at hacker monthly"
