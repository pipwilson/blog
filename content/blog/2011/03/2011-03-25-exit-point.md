It was [twitter](http://twitter.com)‘s fifth birthday last week, which means that [I’ve been there](http://twitter.com/pip) for almost five years now.

My feelings about it are summed up by Ryan Mickle in his post [When free makes your product suck](http://ryanmickle.com/post/4045563701/when-free-sucks):

So I’m looking for a way out. I don’t care that much about posting new tweets (that’s just a bad habit), but keeping up with some interesting people (oh, and the team at work) is something I’d like to do.

A little while ago I set up a local version of [Tweet Nest](http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/), which is a fairly simple backup of the content you post to your twitter account. It was easy to install and works fine for just keeping a backup of what I’m saying.

[ThinkUp](http://thinkupapp.com/) is a more advanced version of the same idea; it keeps what I’m saying but, according to the site and [this brief review](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/putting-twitter-to-work-with-thinkup/28161), everything else as well. A one-stop twitter-backup solution including threaded replies, graphs of followers and a summary of all the links that people have tweeted. I’m fairly tempted to install this and start using it as my primary interface to a read-only twitter.

Will twitter miss me? Probably not. Will I miss out on contributing to conversations? Probably. Am I OK with that? Absolutely.
