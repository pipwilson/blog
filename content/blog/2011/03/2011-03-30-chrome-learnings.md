Things I have learned from the [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/iama) with [three Chrome devs](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gdyun/iama_we_are_three_members_of_the_google_chrome/):

1. about:flags – “Enable better omnibox history matching” (gives you awesomebar-like features, dev channel only)
2. [AutoPatchWork](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aeolcjbaammbkgaiagooljfdepnjmkfd) – Automatically loads the next page and inserts into current page when you reach the end of the page
