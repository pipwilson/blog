It used to be that when I found an article that was too long to read there and then, I would add it to delicious, [tag it as ‘readme’](http://www.delicious.com/pip/readme), and hope that one day I would get around to it.

These days I just click my [Kindlebility](http://kindlebility.darkhax.com/) bookmarklet and read the article next time I’m on the bus or train, but still get value out of the articles that other people are posting to delicious. Am I doing them a disservice by not posting things I think are interesting enough to read? What social obligation am I under to reciprocate in this loose-form network? Why does it worry me? Should I learn to let go, or should I write code to free me from this tyranny?
