Then it could be used for refining Amazon recommendations or whatever.  
First I thought of simply integrating mainstream recommendation service(s) with such data, but then remembered Locker Project and i adapted idea to more future-proof and more open trends.

Similar approach could be used to other “real-world services” which collect your data but barely use it."
