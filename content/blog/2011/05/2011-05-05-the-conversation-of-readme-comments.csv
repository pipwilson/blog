If lots\* of other people have been looking at things you’ve highlighted then they may miss your posts and your contributions are therefore of value to those that miss them.

If you have the time to develop a method of using kindleability+delicious then it all depends if your guilt at not posting outweighs the time taken to develop the function\*\*. If time is limited then I would imagine that the guilt threshold is pushed higher.

So essentially what’s your guilt threshold? How many other people would make you feel too guilty at not posting?

Personally I’ve never used delicious so I’m in no position to add to the guilt threshold and feel no responsibility to the invisible hordes of internet society!

\* for varying values of lots, depending on your own definition etc..

\*\* I’m assuming that anything you develop will be as zero friction to use as Kindleability."
