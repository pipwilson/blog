Whilst I’m thinking about all these [different topics that I’m interested in](http://philwilson.org/blog/2011/06/keep-posting), can anyone help? I’m in the market for a new desktop note-taking tool. It must start up in &lt;3 seconds and save each note as a standalone text file, using some form of text-based notation (like wiki, textile or markdown).

If that didn’t eliminate enough options straight away, it would ideally auto-save every few seconds and allow tree-based note hierarchy. A couple of tools have come close over the years, such as [WikidPad](http://trac.wikidpad2.webfactional.com/), [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org/index.html) and [KeepNote](http://rasm.ods.org/keepnote/), but none have quite hit that sweet spot.

So, any suggestions? I am willing to pay!
