[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Into_the_Spider-Verse) is the best film I’ve seen in the last six months. It’s imaginative, exciting, funny and constantly visually inventive.

If that wasn’t enough, the artists have posted a slew of content about little details in the film (which [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) has [gathered in a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1077737871602110466)), and [sidefx.com interviewed the team about the processes they used](https://www.sidefx.com/community/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/) to create such great results. They used and abused their pre-existing in-house tools which allowed them to write custom Python code and use procedural generation to prototype and create detailed CG effects that looked and felt hand-drawn, which is incredible.

And hey, if you want, you can [even read the screenplay](http://origin-flash.sonypictures.com/ist/awards_screenplays/SV_screenplay.pdf)! Excelsior!
