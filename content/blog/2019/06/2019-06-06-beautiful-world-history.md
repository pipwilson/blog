Twitter is mostly a cesspit of wailing and existential despair and so I avoid it, but the one beacon of light which does call me back in on a regular basis is [Ticia Verveer’s account](https://twitter.com/ticiaverveer).

Ticia is an archaeologist who regularly posts photos and articles of incredible discoveries from around the world, from [a display of noses once used to “repair” Roman and Greek marble statues in the 19th century](https://twitter.com/ticiaverveer/status/1133282127120871424) to [Iron Age mudbricks with 3,000 year old finger impressions](https://twitter.com/ticiaverveer/status/1135894793811300353).

There’s a constant stream of something to learn and wonder at, and isn’t that what we really want from the internet?
