[Jeremy’s written a great roundup of Papercamp](http://adactio.com/journal/1546/), which I wasn’t able to get to. Amongst other things, he says this:

> everyone gathers around a laptop for a demo from Durrell Bishop and Tom Hulbert from <cite>[Luckybite](http://www.luckybite.co.uk/)</cite>. They have a printed book based on their music collection. Each page of the book contains an image—usually an album cover—and a barcode. If you scan the barcode from a page in the book, the corresponding music will play on your computer (or your phone). The book is the <abbr>UI</abbr>. The wireless barcode reader is where the magic happens. If these guys can make a cheap version of this reader, it will fantastic …for all us. Right now the only expensive bit is the reading head but the price could come down as low as a dollar or two.

Surely webcams and QR codes (or variants) are the cheap route here?
