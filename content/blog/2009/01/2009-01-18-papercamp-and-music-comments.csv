Remember, the barcode reader is very small and it’s wireless. The act of dragging it across a barcode in the book is like underlining a passage in a book, filling in a crossword or doodling in the margins."

I was picturing magazines with QR codes next to playlists and album reviews. The only trouble with Spotify URLs is that they won’t work on a phone, so ideally the service at the QR code’s URL would be a generic solution that would output the playlist in multiple formats as appropriate."

You could get a video recorder who’s remote control had a barcode scanner, and if you scanned the barcode, your VCR would record the programme.

Panasonic, apparently.

Anyway, it was utterly crushed by VideoPlus. But there you go, it’s a 20-year-old idea. 🙂"

What’s needed is a camera, a processor that can recognize and decode QRCodes, and medium-range wireless connectivity to a phone, tablet, or PC. This is doable. It was less doable a few years ago, and will be more doable in a few years. With the right software on a phone, it could be a solved problem. IF we can stop thinking of QRCodes as convenient methods for distributing advertisements.

What’s more, I don’t think you should have to wait for a publisher to create pre-augmented publications. Rather, it should be something that you can start slapping, willy nilly, across your printed landscape. Like wiki notes for paper.

Which is a topic for the next PaperCamp…"
