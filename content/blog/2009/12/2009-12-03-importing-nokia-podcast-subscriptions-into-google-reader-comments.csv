Now when I add a podcast I dont have to type in the url, just add it to google reader and it will appear in the directory 🙂"

For what it’s worth though, the podcast subscription dialog in the Podcasting app is quite happy to accept tinyurl-style URLs so I rarely typed full podcast URLs, just short versions and then let the web work its magic on them!"
