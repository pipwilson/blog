Of course, there should probably be some unit tests to check you’re actually getting that HTTP 200.

It would be good, on the other hand, to keep the newsgator-namespaced elements from the feeds they provide (which indicate whether an item has been read or not, for example) and make them available to the Venus templates. A few unit tests would be good here."

And, when I do, should VENUS\_DIR and CACHE\_DIR point to my existing venus-ng stuff? If so, er, what’s my SOURCE\_DIR?

Sorry for the possibly very dim questions – I know naff all about python."

It will grab all the locations from there.

Actually I recently hit a wall with wxVenus because it turns out the HTML renderer it uses on Linux doesn’t support CSS, but I’ll see what I can do anyway. Cheers for giving it a go! 🙂"
