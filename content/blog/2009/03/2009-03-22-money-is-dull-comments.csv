In our case there was a stipulation in the contract that from offer to completion it had to be done in 28 days or it went back on the open market.You can imagine what that month was like.  
I hope it all goes well for you."

WTF?! That’s pretty unusual from what I hear.

I think we’re actually doing pretty well, hopefully we will be sorted soon. The biggest delays have been getting in touch with, and waiting for meetings with, the mortgage adviser. Everything else has been pretty much same-day."

The Estate Agent was under strict instructions in order to clear the debt so had these rules about completion. Even then they allowed viewing’s during that 28 days (no one did tho’).

You’ve been waiting a while for this so I’m really pleased you’re underway. Fingers crossed it’ll be smooth. Are you moving to another town/place or staying roughly where you are?"

We’re staying roughly where we are. We’ve been putting moving off for about two years (partly due to prices but mostly because we’re so amazingly lazy) but we finally decided to get the hell on with it. Completion date was mooted today with a delay for the sellers’ kids to do some exams in May but then pretty sharpish after that. Hurray!"
