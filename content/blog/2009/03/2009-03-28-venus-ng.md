[venus-ng](http://philwilson.org/code/venus-ng/) is a fork of [Venus](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus) which uses [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com) to provide both the reading list and the feeds.

This means that venus-ng will, at a particular point in time, give you an accurate representation of your currently unread Newsgator feed entries. Here is the output from the newsgator.com web aggregator and venus-ng:

venus-ng does not mark feeds as read on the Newsgator server when in retrieves them, although that will likely get added when I have a test Newsgator account set up.

It is currently a fork because I’ve had to modify feedparser.py in a few ways which probably stop it working with other data sources:

1. I’ve changed the way it deals with passed-in urllib2 handlers
2. I’ve commented out the HTTP 401 response behaviour (since I’m passing it an HTTPBasicAuthHandler already)
3. It always passes through an additional X-NGAPIToken HTTP header containing a Newsgator API key

As far as I can tell, the handler refactoring should be fine, but the 401-handling and extra HTTP header seem like a deal-breakers.

I have no idea how to stop the 401 handler in \_FeedURLHandler() conflicting with that in urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler.

I suspect there is a good solution in subclassing urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler to provide the additional Newsgator HTTP header but I’ve not worked out some of the details yet.

You can get the latest source via <kbd>bzr get http://philwilson.org/code/venus-ng</kbd> – there is a sample newsgator.ini file in the /examples directory, but it relies on you already having a Newsgator account and some feeds set up.

Once I’d traced through the Venus code to semi-understand it, this was quite straightforward to do (deal-breaking fork-causers aside) so were Google Reader to introduce an official API it would not take long to integrate.
