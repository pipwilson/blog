I’ve had cause to use both [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/) recently, which are very similar to one another and both of which I quite like.

Git seems slightly slicker, and gives me nicely colourised output, which I’m a sucker for. Then of course there’s [GitHub](http://github.com), which is a very appealing way of easily publishing your code, forking and so on. All of these mean I’ll probably use it in the future.

The command set of Bazaar feels more natural to me, which I miss **a lot** in Git. Its parameters for seemingly simple tasks are comparatively obscure, and to this newbie, poorly explained by the command-line help, a consequence of which is that I have found the [GitHub guides](http://github.com/guides/home) invaluable. Also, I always forget that in Ubuntu running <kbd>sudo apt-get install git</kbd> will not actually install git, but [“GNU Interactive Tools](http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/git), a file browser/viewer and process viewer/killer” (it’s <kbd>sudo apt-get install git-core</kbd>, for reference!).

There’s some interesting commentary on revision control systems as a whole, and the git command set in particular on [Revision Control Systems suck](http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/23/revision-control-systems-suck/) and the [series](http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks/) [of](http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks-2/) [posts](http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/17/git-sucks-3/) he links to.
