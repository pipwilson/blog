In [a comment on peterme.com over a year ago](http://www.peterme.com/?p=678&cpage=1#comment-137749), I said

> I’d like to see a personal dashboard being displayed through one of those digital wifi photo frames attached to the inside of my front door, so I can see the appointments my wife and I have got that day on my way out, plus other reminders based on previously gathered data. It can’t be far away, surely?

Apparently I was wrong, because I’ve not yet seen anyone doing this, but this kind of scenario came up at work the other day and, having forgotten suggesting it before, I suggested it again, in particular, using cron and [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) to take a screenshot of a web page, save it as an image and send it to the wifi photo frame.

This sounds terrifyingly doable, and semi-useful. If I could find a decent, cheap wifi photo frame, that might be something to keep me busy one weekend!
