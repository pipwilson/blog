They’re fast and lightweight, and they don’t require a separate server process. QDBM is pretty mature and has APIs for most languages and packages for every unix and even Windows.  
Tokyo Cabinet is super-cool at the moment but doesn’t have a win32 build as far as I know."

In fact, as I progress with some work around the edges I’m beginning to wonder whether I need anything other than the disk-based XML files I already have (although I need to refactor how I store them).

A little bit of digging suggests that neither QDBM or Tokyo would suit my purposes at the moment – I must be cross-platform (at least Windows and Linux) and I must have Python bindings. No win32 for Tokyo, and no Python for QDBM!"

I know I can use StandaloneZODB but it’s just so much more boring!"
