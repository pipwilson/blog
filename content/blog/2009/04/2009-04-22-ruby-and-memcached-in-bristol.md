I have rather hastily promised to do a talk about [memcached](http://code.google.com/p/memcached/) at the [Bristol Ruby User Group](http://groups.google.com/group/bristol-ruby) meetup on Thursday evening (we’ll start after 6pm at the [Jiva](http://jivatechnology.com/) offices, [see the map](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=BS1%206JG), no need to know about ruby or memcached in advance!).

As ever, this event [is on Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2463558/).

There’s a pub next door which I plan on visiting both before and afterwards, and I also want someone to guide me through the capabilities of [Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) ([specifically, with nginx](http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html)) as well as showing me why all my code is horribly wrong. Come along!
