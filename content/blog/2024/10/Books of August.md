I started but did not finish a friend's copy of Thomas Paine's [Rights of Man](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/rights-of-man-common-sense-and-other-political-writings-thomas-paine/4351991?ean=9780199538003) (1791) which frankly made me far too angry.

On a very different track, I did finish [Guilty by Definition](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Susie-Dent/Guilty-by-Definition--The-instant-Sunday-Times-bestsellin/30145160) by [Susie Dent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Dent). Absolutely fine debut fiction novel from the world's leading lexicographer. A girl goes missing, a man is murdered. Can solving puzzles straight out of [the GCHQ Puzzlebook](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/GCHQ/The-GCHQ-Puzzle-Book--Perfect-for-anyone-who-likes-a-good-headscratcher/19967858) solve these crimes? You betcha.

[The Man who fell to earth](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-man-who-fell-to-earth-the-best-of-the-sf-masterworks-walter-tevis/2806105?ean=9781399607834) by [Walter Tevis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tevis) is about loneliness, isolation, and drinking gin. Really good, although morose. I first saw this as a film when I was in my mid teens, the 1970s version with David Bowie as the lead. Astonishing to me is that this is written by the same author who wrote [The Queen's Gambit](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-queen-s-gambit-now-a-major-netflix-drama-walter-tevis/2300286?ean=9781474600842), which was dramatized on Netflix a few years ago. That too is a tale of isolation and the desperate need to make human connections in amongst a larger challenge. Tevis _also_ wrote [The Color of Money](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-color-of-money-walter-tevis/2509012?ean=9781560254850) which became the film with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. A pretty good output!
