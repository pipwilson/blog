I have a new page on my website to show me [how much distance I've tracked with Strava this year](https://philwilson.org/strava/).

It's powered by [this JSON file](https://philwilson.org/strava/monthly_distances.json) and [this Zola template](https://github.com/pipwilson/blog/blob/production/themes/philwilson.org/templates/strava.html), which renders the data out as a static webpage like the rest of the site.

The JSON file is generated by some Python scripts I wrote which pulls all my data from [the Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) and then processes it into a number of other files which I can use for things like this without also publishing e.g. my current GPS location!

It's easy to [get started with the Strava API](https://www.strava.com/settings/api) and [the docs are pretty clear](https://developers.strava.com/docs/) but I used an existing third-party library called [Stravalib](https://github.com/stravalib/stravalib), and there is [a good walkthrough of setting that up from scratch](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/accessing-user-data-via-the-strava-api-using-stravalib-d5bee7fdde17).

The Zola template uses the same approach that I took with [displaying my blog posting stats](https://philwilson.org/blog/stats/) - read the data from somewhere; display it all in a table; work out which data value is biggest and then set the width of a span in each row to be a relative percentage of the biggest value - this is super effective and a really nice trick I stole [from Rob Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/stats/).

All I need to do now is work out a nice low-cost, low-effort way of keeping that file updated - which in my case probably means porting my Python code to PHP so I can run it in a cheap webhost. Thankfully there are again [existing libraries to make this easier](https://github.com/basvandorst/StravaPHP).
