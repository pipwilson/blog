Gosh, April nearly slipped away without me noting what I read last month. Here we go:

1. [Gateway by Frederik Pohl](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Frederik-Pohl/Gateway/1528984), one of the [S.F. Masterworks](https://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Search?Series=S.F.%20Masterworks) series and an odd book, more about a manâ€™s visit to his (robot) psychiatrist than exploring the galaxy (and certainly not the space opera I was sold by the blurb on the back), but an interesting start to a series of books for sure.

2. [Lest Darkness Fall](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/L-Sprague-deCamp/Lest-Darkness-Fall/11472173) by L. Sprague deCamp (unavailable in print copy, ebook only) - what can you do if you're an archaeologist suddenly catapulted into the decline of the Roman Empire? Well, this book from 1939 explores that idea, and is pretty well executed, a contemporary review saying "Next to Wells's "Time Machine", this could be the best time-travel novel ever written.". I had never thought that knowing how to distil brandy would be so important.

3. Because one of them was by Martha Wells (of [Murderbot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries) fame) and another by [Yoon Ha Lee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Ha_Lee), I read some of the short stories in the free ebook about health and the planet, [Take Us to a Better Place](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B083WPZ83D). They were OK but the writing quality was quite mixed and it didn't really feel like a coherent collection.

4. [The Place of the Lion](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Charles-Williams/The-Place-of-the-Lion/27123749) by Charlies Williams - one of the [Inklings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inklings) alongside Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Fairly hard going, and it took me a long time to get through this, but really good, really interesting actual _literature_ rather than my regular pulp reading. Feels like I should have had some kind of informed study group to read this with!
