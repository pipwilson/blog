This week I had to chase a badger out of the garden because it was trying to break into my food waste bin, and break up a fight between some robins and goldfinches.

Spring on the edge of the city is literally wild.

* I made it more obvious on [/bins](https://philwilson.org/bins/) which bin needs to be collected next (I mostly look at this on my phone so BIG LETTERS and <span style="background-color: lightgreen">background colours</span> are good). [Code](https://github.com/pipwilson/bin-collections/) and [why I wrote this](https://philwilson.org/blog/2023/10/when-my-bins-go-out/).
* I shredded two crates' worth of paperwork going back to 2001. Boring work, but look! now I have two crates' worth of space to fill with Lego!
* Did lots of [playing with my blog](https://github.com/pipwilson/blog/commits/production/), including bugfixes and template changes so it publishes faster, and spent a bit of time thinking about how to add comments
* On Monday the girl and I watched Mary Poppins for her first ever time, and we spent the rest of the morning walking into rooms and calling "Step in time!" and doing a little dance
* My [blibloop](https://www.blibloop.com/) Legend of Zelda prints arrived!

![A photo of three prints I ordered from blibloop.com](/images/2024/04/blibloop-prints.jpg)

* Spent a bit of time bashing away at a couple of cross-platform desktop apps, and if I ever get them to work properly I'll write about them
* Went through most of [Microsoft's AI-900 course on AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-900t00). Nothing particularly novel in it, and mostly a sales pitch as normal, but nice to go through it all in a structured way.

That's definitely enough for now. Have a good weekend, dear reader.
