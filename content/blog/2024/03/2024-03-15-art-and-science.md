I open a lot of tabs. A lot. Maybe as many as you.

Every now and then I have to plough through them and close down stuff I’ve either dealt with, bookmarked, or just forgotten why I opened it in the first place. I’ve given up doing this on my phone where my Firefox tab count is permanently ∞ (literally).

So here are some interesting tabs I’ve had open this week:

- [Who were the people of Stonehenge? Curators’ Tour of The World of Stonehenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FymNP8copac) – a video by The British Museum (you can also get [the accompanying coffee table book](https://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/the-world-of-stonehenge-hardback.html))
- [This Is Not a Vermeer](https://medium.com/message/this-is-not-a-vermeer-67b752b150c0) – a multi-part series about Vermeer, authenticity and the meaning of art
- [Resetting digital government](https://archive.is/dnxSg) in Computer Weekly – sample quote “Adopt systems thinking to improve policy outcomes”
- [The section from The Domesday Book](https://opendomesday.org/place/ST7567/charlcombe/) which is probably closest to where I live in Bath (just 12 people in the households in the year 1086, about 350-400 in 2024)
- [A blog post about tweet archival](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/i-archived-my-tweets/). I really need to get on this – I’ve done several exports over the years in the hopes of doing….something with it. Hopefully switching to static site publishing will give me a nice easy-to-use home for those exported tweets?
- The [US Department of Defense Guide to Detecting Agile Bullshit](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Oct/09/2002049591/-1/-1/0/DIB_DETECTING_AGILE_BS_2018.10.05.PDF)

Also lots and lots of things about OPML, which chimes nicely with some recent thinking I’ve been having about managing blogrolls. More on that in another post I think.
