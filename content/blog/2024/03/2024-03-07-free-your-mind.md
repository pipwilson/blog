The absolute best thing about being able to hand over my Head of Software Engineering role to the wonderful [Steve Newstead](https://medium.com/@steve.newstead) in favour of being a roving problem-solver (currently: incident management processes, procurement workflows, monitoring and alerting, line management coaching) has been the colossal amount of mental capacity it has freed up outside of work hours.

This means I have the space to do things like a) write this blog! b) [write code](https://github.com/pipwilson?tab=repositories)! and most importantly c) read!

This means a resurrection of my feed-reading habits for a start (more on that another time) but also that when people I know and respect [post linklogs](https://digitalbydefault.com/2024/02/29/old-man-yells-at-cloud-digital-gov-edition/) I have time to actually plough through some of that material they’re sharing, and then read the links out from *there* as well!

I am always desperate to learn something new and interesting – it is my favourite dopamine hit. Whether it’s about [strategy implementation](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-275-bad-strategy-why), the [differences in people’s visual imaginations](https://www.flourish.org/2023/03/this-kind-of-rosy-yellow-glow-in-my-head/), or services that “[check for link rot in real-time, and fall back to the Internet Archive to restore broken links](https://remysharp.com/2023/12/04/unrot-that-link)”, I love it all.

I’ll be off to my next contract soon, at which point work will be consuming all my spare mental cycles once again, so it’s a pleasure to try and make the most of my brain whilst I’ve got it to myself!
