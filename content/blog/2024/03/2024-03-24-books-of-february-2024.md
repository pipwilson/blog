As predicted it was impossible to maintain [the rate of January](https://philwilson.org/blog/2024/02/books-of-january-2024/), obviously this is a system which I can game if I just read novellas!

[Ella Minnow Pea](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/ella-minnow-pea-mark-dunn/3739179?ean=9780413772954) – a fictional story of authoritarianism implemented through removing letters from the alphabet and punishing those that continue to use them. Very good.

[Sooner or Later Everything Falls into the Sea](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/sooner-or-later-everything-falls-into-the-sea-sarah-pinsker/2542837?ean=9781800243941) – a good collection of sci-fi/fantasy short stories which was [nominated for a Nebula Award in 2016](https://nebulas.sfwa.org/award-year/2016/). only one of the stories didn’t really work for me, although it was perfectly good. The first few in particular are excellently melancholic pieces and I’m still thinking about them a month on.

[Lockwood books 3, 4 and 5](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/lockwood-co-the-empty-grave-jonathan-stroud/380381?ean=9780552575799) – the overarching plot across the whole series was good, but sadly the final book was the worst individual book. Despite it being action-packed and interesting, there were loose threads, late-appearing unpredictable surprises that changed the main story arc, and more mysteries that we know will never get resolved. Frustrating given that books 1-4 built a nice, mostly consistent world with a real sense of jeopardy and mystery. Maybe the author thought he’d written himself into a corner? We’ll never know.

Also, I read some [classic Asterix books](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/asterix-asterix-and-the-cauldron-album-13-rene-goscinny/56342?ean=9780752866291). Do they count too?
