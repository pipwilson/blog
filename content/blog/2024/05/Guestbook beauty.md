Eva Decker has [an incredible guestbook](https://eva.town/guestbook).

![A screenshot of Eva Decker's guestbook, which looks like differently-styled index cards with the message on them, laid out in a grid by human hands](/images/2024/05/lovely-guestbook.png)

Not only does it look wonderful but she's also [written up the creative design process](https://eva.town/posts/design-outside-the-computer) which was, gasp!, based in the real world with physical items!

Eva also links to the inspiration for the index-card style layout on [Lean's guestbook](https://leanrada.com/guestbook/).

Really lovely stuff - I need to get around to supporting a guestbook at some point!
