[Perplexity AI Is Lying about Their User Agent](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/)

If you are taking "misleading" actions in order to make money you are unethical and if you don't fix things you need to be thrown into a firey pit. That's it. That's the post.

That's also why it's so INCREDIBLY disappointing to see, in amongst hordes of morons who don't think any web publisher should be able to block anyone from accessing their content, people I'd normally respect (but who have become completed enamoured by the technical fun of playing with LLMs and the kind of uses it might unlock) prepared to overlook illegal actions which improve the share price of those companies, at the expense of people who EXPLICITLY don't want those LLMs accessing their data.

I'm not currently aware of any legal action from companies or people in the UK against US-based AI organisations but my goodness it's surely just a matter of time.
