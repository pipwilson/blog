- [Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_IV:_The_Voyage_Home)
- [Tatami Time Machine Blues](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=24871) - OK, not a film, but really good fun.
- [The Map of Tiny Perfect Things](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Map_of_Tiny_Perfect_Things)

I think some don't quite qualify - e.g. 13 going on 30, Edge of Tomorrow and Interstellar all have time travel components to them, but don't quite make it to my heading of "time travel plays a major ongoing component of this film". Getting frozen and waking up later doesn't count either (hello Demolition Man!)

Most of those are actually pretty good, but the one I have the fondest adult memories of (rather than ones I watched as a kid and have automatic rose-coloured filters applied) is Palm Springs. It's [free to stream on Amazon Prime in the UK right now](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/palm-springs).

# And ones I haven't seen yet (or have I?) but want to (yet - or have I?)
Are there any? Maybe [Frequency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_(2000_film)) and [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Leapt_Through_Time_(2006_film))?
