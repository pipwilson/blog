I have bought [Go: The Complete Developer’s Guide on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/go-the-complete-developers-guide/). It’s been a good intro so far, but there are more than 90 videos, and I’d quite like to do some each day at work, where streaming video isn’t always allowed.

The author of this course has allowed his videos to be downloaded, but that’s on a video-by-video basis. I’d like to grab all of them.

[udemy-dl](https://github.com/r0oth3x49/udemy-dl) has me covered, downloading all the videos in mp4 format and grabbing the subtitles too. This is almost certainly against the Udemy terms and conditions, but in practice will be very useful. Who knows, maybe I’ll even end up buying more courses!
