About a year after my son was born, when my memory started working again, I started writing a blog about the things he was getting up to.

I started it on 19 September 2010, 2718 days ago. In that time I have made 733 posts, roughly one every four days. Obviously there are peaks and troughs, but that’s a nice average to have. Enough time can pass between each one for something new, nice or surprising to happen and warrant recording.

I don’t use pictures, only words, because I’m keen that moving blogging platforms, or the vagaries of image resizing don’t destroy it over time. In 18 months my son will be ten, I think that’ll probably be enough posts to get it printed out and bound. I’ve used <https://www.lulu.com/> many times with great success, but there are other services which do WordPress-specific imports so hopefully I’ll find something which lets me do it nice and easily as well as making something that looks good, and lets me preserve my digital record [well past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_literature) the ability of any digital records management.
