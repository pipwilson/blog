Growing up I played the board games that you might expect a kid growing up in the 80s to play: Scrabble, Monopoly, Frustration, Cluedo and so on. Although I mostly enjoyed them, they were all tedious in their own ways. The more interesting the game, the longer it took, and the more “adult” it was seen to be and was therefore either out of reach of my younger sibling or took to long to play with my parents. Today is very different.

Sites like https://boardgamegeek.com/ mean that it’s possible to find games for my kids which don’t take too long to play and are also accessible for their ages, meaning they’re much more fun!

As well as some of the classics like “Guess Who” and “Connect 4” we’ve acquired [Kingdomino](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino), [Castle Panic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43443/castle-panic) and [Labyrinth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1219/labyrinth), all of which are good fun.

On our horizon I can definitely see [Catan Junior](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/184842/catan-junior) and [Ticket to Ride: First Journey (Europe)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218208/ticket-ride-first-journey-europe). Hopefully my kids will be able to look back on the board games they played with pleasure rather than mild horror, and will be able to play better, more interesting games as they grow up.
