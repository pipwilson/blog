I was busy writing a blog post about types of dependency injection, since it’s come up a few times at work, but it seems as though [Roger](https://kinbiko.com/) has done it for me: [Java: Spring Dependency Injection Patterns – The good, the bad, and the ugly](https://kinbiko.com/java/dependency-injection-patterns/).

Basically: use constructor injection.
