From [Odeon: when will they learn?](http://usamajility.blogspot.com/2007/04/odeon-when-will-they-learn.html):

> Let’s make this clear: whoever is in charge of the Odeon website is an utter incompetent. Because of their atrocious booking system this will be my first visit in years. With the thought that I might have to use their website again, it will also be my last for years. If I’d worked on that website I would be absolutely ashamed of myself.
