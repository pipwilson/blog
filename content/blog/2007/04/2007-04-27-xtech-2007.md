I’m going to [XTech 2007](http://2007.xtech.org) in Paris this year.

I’ll be trying to attend talks on [Jabber](http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/90), the [future of HTML](http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/187), [improving data collaboration](http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/158) and [smart ambient devices](http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/228).

Are you going? Let me know in the comments or drop me an email on phil@philwilson.org (my Jabber server is down at the moment).
