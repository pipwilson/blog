Florence is lovely. And also horrible. During the week day mornings the air is thick with the smog from all the scooters; later it clears and you can see the oldest art gallery in the world.

After you’ve been marvelling at one of Italy’s great cathedrals you walk past rows of buildings daubed with graffiti.

Of the hundreds of photos I took with my shiny new 7.2 megapixel camera, I have [a Flickr set containing eleven of them](http://flickr.com/photos/pip/sets/72157600095318292/).
