GPS fix in under 30 secs – usually under 15 secs, faster camera, faster everything, more available memory, demand paging – the list goes on!  
Also – nokia release firmware a couple of times a year so its not that big a deal reinstalling apps. At least they provide a backup/restore tool which restores settings, contacts and calendar easily."

As a matter of fact, I dont loose any data in the process. Some applications (Papyrus, Google Maps) needed to be re-installed, but not that much. And the V20 firmware really rocks!"

Of course, I’m not on Windows which is a requirement I’ll have to deal with."
