![An image of the PINsentry tool](http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/11/pinsentry.gif)

Apparently at the end of this month I’ll be sent a small tool to make my online banking more secure. It’s called [PINsentry](http://www.barclays.co.uk/pinsentry/). As far as I, as a selfish user, can see it’s actually designed to make my online banking experience slower and limit it to one location at a time (unless I want to drag it around with me at all times).

The website does actually provide [a list of FAQs](http://www.barclays.co.uk/pinsentry/questions.html) but for some inexplicable reason it’s Flash-based so I can’t actually link to the one which says that if I don’t have my reader with me I can view my accounts and nothing more.

I’ll save any further comment until I’ve received it, but at the moment I’m not feeling particularly generous.
