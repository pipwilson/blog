I’m quite happy to have my PayPal/eBay keychain dongle (<https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/cps/general/FAQPPSecurityKey-outside>), not least because it also works with my OpenID provider, but if I had more than one, it might get a bit on the annoying side."

Presumably the warnings that it gives you right at the bottom of the “common questions” page (I’d cut and paste, but… hnnng) are to prevent social engineering attacks? If that’s the case, isn’t this just another level of *perception* of security? I can see it would help prevent ongoing or delayed fraud, but does it prevent live man-in-the-middle relay attacks?

Kind of hoping they send me one now, just to see what it’s like…"

The Barclay’s Q&amp;A on this is just a disaster – on the front page there’s a list of questions but they’re not clickable to their answers, just a link for “see the answers to these questions!” and then those questions aren’t the first thing on the page. And then it’s in Flash. Rubbish."
