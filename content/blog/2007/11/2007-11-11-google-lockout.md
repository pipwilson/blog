Well, I had been about to post about using Android, the new Google thing for mobile devices, but they seem to have [disabled my main Google Account](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=61805) meaning that I can’t use anything I was logged out of, including Gmail and Blogger, which means I’m writing this by hand and that comments are, er, disabled. Yeah, disabled. I can certainly say that Google’s help pages are woefully poor on this and do not provide an apparent point of contact so that I can find out what’s going on. If I was a small business using Gmail, I would be shafted. As it is, I’m merely very pissed off.
