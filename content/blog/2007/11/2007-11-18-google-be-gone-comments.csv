Ironically, I’ve resumed using Microsoft products recently."

I was left logged in to Google Reader, Google Search and iGoogle (and still am).

Here is the error message I get sent to : <https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=61805>

As far as I can tell I’ve done nothing actually wrong, and trying to contact them has so far been fruitless.

Of course, all my Google Docs are left in limbo, my Google Maps are inaccessible etc. etc. etc."

If they suspect a TOS violation, they could just prevent you from sending email through them, or perhaps from receiving mail as well, rather than locking you out of your account entirely."

Shouldn’t have to, but self-hosting is probably the best policy if they’re going to issue summary justice without warning.

You didn’t say something about Search Engines and China did you? 😉 Hope that they get you back on as soon as."

I hope they recognise the trouble they’ve caused."

I’ve not heard anything at all about why it went away or why it’s come back (or even that it had done – if I hadn’t checked I still wouldn’t know).

I’m currently in the process of backing up everything I can get my hands on.

Luckily I still own my blogger archives so I’ve put the static HTML in place underneath WordPress – I’m looking at the easiest way of migrating them into WordPress right now."

They have a little more downtime than Google, often due to the lads fiddling around on the production server when they shouldn’t, but they’re a lot more accountable and can be reached by phone if all else fails. They also did IMAP a long time before Google did."
