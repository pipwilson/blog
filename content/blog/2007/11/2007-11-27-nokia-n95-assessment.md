I got a first-generation Nokia N95 two months ago. [The Gadget Show](http://gadgetshow.five.tv/index.htm) rated it better than the iPhone in pure functionality. Ben Ward ([and his commenters](http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/nokia-n95-sucks/)) have had [some really serious problems](http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/n95-gone/), so I thought I‚Äôd give a hopefully more balanced view.

With that in mind, I‚Äôve had a mobile phone for the last ten years and my favourites have all been Nokias which means that I‚Äôm very, very familiar with the Symbian OS. Thanks to [JimH](http://feetup.org/blog) I was on the Early Access trial of [Python for S60](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonfors60/). All of this serves to show that I like to think I‚Äôm balanced but I‚Äôm probably not üôÇ

Executive summary: The Nokia N95 is a great phone, but terribly terribly slow. If you get one, buy the newer [Nokia N95 8GB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95#N95_8GB) which has a bigger screen, better battery life and obviously more memory.

<ins datetime="2008-02-25T22:40:12Z">I‚Äôve now [upgraded the firmware](http://philwilson.org/blog/2008/02/upgrade-nokia-n95-to-v20-firmware) and the whole device is much, much snappier, including the previously ponderous camera</ins>

### The good

The integrated WiFi means that I now use the podcasting support above texting, phonecalls, calendaring and taking photos. But it‚Äôs a poorly integrated application; for example the bundled WebKit-based browser supports RSS subscriptions but this list is separate from your podcast subscriptions and items are not interchangeable. This means it is very difficult to browse to a site which provides podcasts and then subscribe in a suitable application (the best route seems to be copy and paste of the URL). You can at least import and subscribe to an OPML file so you‚Äôre best off maintaining the list online somewhere, perhaps using something like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and an [rss2opml](http://dannyayers.com/2006/02/07/delicious-reading-lists/) converter.

The TV-out is great and actually useful given the native mp4 support and free xvid player available.

Running [Apache on your mobile phone](http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/mobile-web-server/) is super-cool and would open some interesting possibilities if it didn‚Äôt murder your battery life.

Python support is good and getting better all the time. Most of the phone‚Äôs functions are available to scripts, making it quite straightforward to hack your phone, provided you can [set up a decent develop/deploy/test cycle](http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/PyS60_Bluetooth_console)

My [3](http://www.three.co.uk)-branded X-Series N95 came with Skype and MS Live Messenger and a simple menu layout.

If you hurled it at someone hard enough, you could probably kill them.

The 5MP camera with Carl Zeiss lens is amazing but‚Ä¶

### The bad

The 5MP camera with Carl Zeiss lens is amazing but slow beyond belief and pushes it very almost beyond utility.

As with most Nokia phones in the past five years they seem to have too many hardware designers. As [Russ says](http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/some-nokia-n95-and-s60-thoughts), the dual-direction slide is a gimmick and the media buttons should be elsewhere. They would have had room for them if they hadn‚Äôt had so many redundant buttons on the existing design. When the slide is open for normal use and including the keypad, there are twenty-nine buttons available. Twenty-nine! I never even use one of the largest two (about which Russ says <q>The ‚Äúmedia key‚Äù is stupid and the media menu is stupid</q>)! I say this every time, but Nokia need to drastically rethink their button strategy.

Connecting the phone to your PC via mini-USB does not charge it.

Some of Ben‚Äôs other criticisms are valid:

- the ‚Äúnotes‚Äù app can‚Äôt be synced. The phone comes with no other text viewer or editor.
- changing between profile and landscape views aren‚Äôt accelerometer based, despite there being one
- the gallery application is a step backwards from the previous version found on devices like the 6630 (presumably because of the increased size per photo)

### The indifferent

The GPS has been variable for me. Sometimes I get a fix within 30 seconds, othertimes it takes up to five minutes, which is clearly useless. Nevertheless, as a first-generation device with this functionality it makes a good first pass with excellent application support where the location will default back to that of the cell ID you‚Äôre connected to.

The iPhone has quite good overall usability, most other phones suck at usability and I‚Äôve certainly got used to it.

Other criticisms seem to be unfounded:

- text recipients can be chosen by typing their name in, you don‚Äôt have to browse
- I can‚Äôt find a place outside of third-party apps where the number pad can‚Äôt be used for navigation
- Each entry in the missed call list has an option ‚Äúuse number‚Äù which appears to reflect the number which called
- the battery life is more or less what I‚Äôd expect from a handheld device running bluetooth, GPS, Wifi a digital camera and a phone.

There is [a brand-new firmware release out today](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/6308_The_N95_classic_hits_v20_firmw.php) which claims to solve a number of these problems, but it requires you to completely wipe the internal memory and reinstall all your apps and reconfigure your phone. As one of the commenters on the AllAboutSymbian article [says](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/forum/showthread.php?t=66910&page=2#post349208) <q cite="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/forum/showthread.php?t=66910&page=2#post349208">Imagine having to do a complete re-install every time Microsoft released a Service Pack.</q> Eugh.
