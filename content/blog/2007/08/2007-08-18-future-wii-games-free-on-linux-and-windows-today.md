If you’re looking forward to [Blast Works on the Wii](http://www.destructoid.com/geometric-shooter-blast-works-coming-to-the-wii-33812.phtml) next year then you probably want to spend some time playing [Tumiki Fighters](http://tumiki.sourceforge.net/) which as far as I can tell is what it’s based on. I’ve been playing Tumiki Fighters and [rRootage](http://rrootage.sourceforge.net/) (both by [Kenta Cho](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/), probably more famous for his [Tempest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_%28arcade_game%29)-a-like [Torus Trooper](http://www.emhsoft.com/ttrooper/)) for a couple of months now and they’re both totally enjoyable shooters in a very old-school vein and well worth the quick and easy download.Give them a go!
