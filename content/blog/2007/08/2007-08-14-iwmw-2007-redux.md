I’d like to thank everyone who put up with my ‘[eternal beta](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2007/sessions/wilson2/)‘ session at IWMW 2007 – it was baking hot and I had a cracking headache, so congratulations for not hurling chairs and broken glass at me!

In other news it was good to catch up with a number of people and to meet a lot of new ones, although I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the number of people I’d apparently met before and blind forgotten or who knew who I was in advance. It was good to meet you all, and many thanks to the girls from Essex for taking me to task about [my electronic, motorised rabbit](http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/01/nabaztag.html) (specialist stockists only).

I only stayed for a day (although went out for a drink the night before) but even in that short period it was interesting to see what kind of people with what kind of backgrounds were embracing new tech to what extent. I think [Paul twittering in the pub](http://twitter.com/boagworld/statuses/151433502) was the first live-action Twitter I’d seen.

A good event, [videos are online](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~apbl500/stream/ukoln/live/live.html), as are a lot of [the presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/group/iwmw-2007), and many thanks to the organisers!
