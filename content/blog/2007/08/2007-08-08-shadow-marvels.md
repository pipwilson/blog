I have a number of blog posts I want to make. About Jabber, about Edinburgh, about wikis, about [Venus](http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/).

Iâ€™ve just read this story [Shadow lamps to connect friends on the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6936627.stm) and I absolutely love it.

How could we do something similar at home? Off the top of my head: maybe a webcam taking shots every x seconds and then using [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) to do an inverted monochrome transform and post to the web (copy to public\_html, FTP, whatever) and then use some desktop gadget system (Google Gadgets, Yahoo! Widgets, GNOME panel applet whatever) to pull it down and embed it?

Sounds good!
