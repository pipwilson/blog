I’d already got as far as working out the URL but was then kind of stumped for a way of downloading the rtmp stream (without using something like Orbit Downloader). Often you can just change the rtmp:// to http:// and the stream will work using the RTMPT protocol, but unfortunately this doesn’t seem to work.

Hopefully Red5 will provide the missing link, although from a quick glance at the source code I’m not entirely sure how to do it.

Java definitely seems the way to go though, as it would allow a signed applet to be added to the pages via greasemonkey which could provide a download button for the flv files.

Now I just have to work out how Red5 works!

I’m somewhat affiliated with RTMPy and although you are correct in that RTMP implemenation is incomplete yet, there is active work being done on it. So far, we have alpha support for AMF through \[PyAMF\](<http://pyamf.org/>) which is being used as the basis for the RTMP implementation.

If you would be interesting in helping out with a client for downloading from BBC in the near future, that would be an intersting test for RTMP client functionality. Please stop by our mailing list if you feel so inclined 🙂"

I see MythTV working on this, and I was linked from a thread on the XBox Media Center forums: <http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27063>

I’ve gotten as far as decompiling the flash player to see what it’s doing and deciding that it’s going to take considerably longer than a dull Saturday afternoon to hack something together.

How are you getting the URLs? I’ve found the stream traffic was encrypted."

But that still won’t cross the hurdle of actually getting the url in the first place."

Alas, it is also only available for Windows, but it does the job marvellously and you can’t fault the price."

A few extra bits I found out:

The SECRET\_KEY changes every time you request the mediaselector file.

The reply when you request the mediaselector file includes the header ‘Vary: Cookie’, which indicates to caching proxies that they should get a fresh copy every time the cookies change."

using Firefox 3.0.1 on Linux:

I’ve just uploaded a new version with proper radio download support—which just meant detecting radio programmes and changing the extension to mp3!

That’s version 0.1.12 of the library and command-line tools, and version 1.8 of the GUI.

Hurra !"

Then just take the URL and download it with mplayer. Here is the result of the nice radio program

Video seems to be harder since you probably need to find a nice proxy in the UK.  
If you succed – put the result on <http://thepiratebay.org>
