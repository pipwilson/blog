Please let me know if you have any problems with WiidiaPlayer, if it’s MTASC you’re having trouble with, it took me a couple of days myself to get it working.

The player part of WiidiaPlayer is nothing more though than what you can build using the FLash IDE; it still won’t allow you to download anything.

The solution to downloading is not that hard though: the WiidiaServer should be able to get you on your way there. The problem is that the wiidiaserver speaks only the server-part of the protocol, and you’d need the client part; still almost all that you need is there.

RTMP (for video) is nothing more than a handshake, a play command from the client, and an flv file hacked into pieces and padded with headers.

Come to think of it: probably the easiest way to save an RTMP stream is just to let it play in the browser, capture the stream into a file (not entirely sure how to do this, I’m sure a little hacking with tcpdump should do the trick), and then using a simple parser to filter out the bits that are flv (most of the code for that is there in the WiidiaServer).

I wouldn’t mind helping you on your way, but as I recall the iPlayer streams are ip-limited to the UK (I live in the Netherlands); still anything I can do, let me know!"

FYI, your suggested method of download via playing in the browser and capturing it is exactly how one of the commercial tools I tested, Replay Media Catcher, does it.

The last time I did anything at all in Flash was in 2001, so it’s all very exciting. Still, if the RTMP stream is as simple as you suggest, maybe I should take a closer at the python client I earlier dismissed for incompleteness."

This is all very interesting. On the above xbmc thread I saw the entry by Strawp with the PHP script showing how to derive the  
RTMP stream URL and thought that it might be fun to create a Firefox bookmarklet that does the same thing.

The resultant bookmarklet works on both the BBC iPlayer page variants (e.g. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/page/item/aaaaaaaa.shtml> and <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/aaaaaaaa>).

Get it here:

In other words, gnash is probably going to be the only way to do it."

I came across hulu.com which also uses RTMP streams to stream their video. I googled and read bits from the rtmp threads at xbmc.org and of course this article you wrote. 🙂 I just wanted let you know that RTMP support on xbmc is wanted for more applications than bbc player, and what’s the xbmc status on adding this? I couldn’t find any kind of definite answer on the forums..

Thanks.."
