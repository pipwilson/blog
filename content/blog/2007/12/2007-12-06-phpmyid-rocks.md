30 minutes from ssh-ing into my server to having [my own (decrufted) OpenID](http://philwilson.org/id/).

Many thanks to [PHPMyID](http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/), [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/12/05/phpMyId-0-7) and [openidenabled.com](http://www.openidenabled.com/resources/openid-test/diagnose-server).

<ins datetime="2007-12-10T23:03:28Z">I should point out that I was forced to do this because [videntity.org](http://videntity.org/) was 404 when I wanted to log in to something. Danger Will Robinson.</ins>
