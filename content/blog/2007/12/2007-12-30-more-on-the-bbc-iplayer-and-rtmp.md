There appears to be some work going on to try and get iPlayer working on the XBox Media Center according to [this thread on their forums](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=27063) (thanks for the link, [Iain](http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/12/downloading-from-the-bbc-streaming-iplayer-is-hard#comment-75)) and although it only seems to make progress up to where I did, it does include this comment from [Ian Forrester](http://www.cubicgarden.com/) of backstage.bbc.co.uk (a terribly nice chap who I met at XTech 2007 in Paris, and who as it turns out used to DJ at a club I used to go to in Bristol) [<q>Weâ€™re happy for people to hack around for non-commercial uses.</q>](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?s=67da522ab9cf73be97d0f6e4b93442fa&t=27063&page=3#post161280) which is really good to hear.

Additionally, tonight I came across [WiidiaPlayer](http://wiidiaplayer.wordpress.com/) which is built in MTASC, <q cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTASC">an open-source ActionScript 2.0 compiler written in OCaml</q> and [plays back RTMP streams](http://wiidiaplayer.wordpress.com/category/rtmp/). Wiidiaplayer [is open source](http://wiidiaplayer.wordpress.com/yes-it-is-open-source/) and [that source is on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/wiidiaplayer/). My initial tests havenâ€™t been that successful, but theyâ€™ve only been ten minutes long ðŸ™‚
