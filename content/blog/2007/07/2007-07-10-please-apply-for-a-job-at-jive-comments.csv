I noticed in your link, problems included inability to autopopulate roster, due to LDAP groups not being supported. Might I assume you are using AD or openldap? We struggled with groups a bit using openldap and came up with a bit of a hack to get it working. Let me know some more details and perhaps I can be of assistance."

We are currently on OpenLDAP but are moving sometime soon to Sun’s Directory Server I think."
