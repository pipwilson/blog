At work [we’re playing with Openfire](http://wiki.bath.ac.uk/display/bucswebdev/Jabber+server), the Java-based Jabber/XMPP server. There are parts that are \*cough\* sub-optimal so we want to fix them. [It’s open source](http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/source.jsp) and builds using [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). So far, so straightforward.

I want to modify some core code so went looking for the [unit tests](http://junit.sourceforge.net/) to make sure that my changes wouldn’t break anything. Oh dear lord. A few hours of sobbing to myself later and I can only hope that they get someone [for this job](http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/job-JVHSJ65C0AP-l-Portland-OR-c-Technology "QA Engineer: Jive Software") really soon.
