I can’t make it to IWMW this year, but your presentation sounds very useful (I rolled out an auto-suggest / AJAX version of our search yesterday – our first beta release of anything since I’ve been here) – I’d love to see your materials afterwards if that’s okay (unless they broadcast it of course!)

Start typing in the message box on [http://help.geni.com/index.php?departmentid=5&amp;\_m=tickets&amp;\_a=submit&amp;step=1](http://help.geni.com/index.php?departmentid=5&_m=tickets&_a=submit&step=1) to see it if you haven’t already.

In talk-related news, I’ll be putting the slides online afterwards, although this year they’ll be OpenOffice based rather than S5, just for a change really 🙂 I think it also exports as Flash so I may put that up in addition."

Having seen the Genie link you sent, I’d appreciate you casting your eye over this: [Search Beta](http://ljmu.ac.uk/cis/webpublishing/searchbeta.asp)

It’s rough and ready, but if it takes off then we can refine it."
