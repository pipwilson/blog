Going on holiday is a bad idea. A recent rundown:

- Paris, September 2004 – [Beslan school hostage crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beslan_siege)
- Cornwall, July 2005 – [London bombings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7/7)
- Norway, August 2006 – [transatlantic aircraft plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot)
- Birmingham, June 2007 – [Glasgow International Airport attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Glasgow_International_Airport_attack)

I mean, it’s just coincidence, right? Right?
