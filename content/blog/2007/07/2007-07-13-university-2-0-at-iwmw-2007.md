I almost forgot to say that [I’ll be in York on Monday](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2007/sessions/wilson2/) at the [Institutional Web Management Workshop 2007](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2007/) presenting [“The eternal beta – can it work in an institution?”](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2007/sessions/wilson2/), I’ll be covering practical ways that Universities can incorporate web 2.0-style technologies into their software development, rollout and maintenance lifecycles as well as how to harvest staff/student-based feedback in an intelligent way.

The title is the most boring ever but I wasn’t quite confident enough to name it “University 2.0” which is what was suggested to me. Rather like the title, the abstract was knocked up in under five minutes and remains now as it did when I wrote it. Obviously it’d been a day of meetings 🙂

The slides are now online, probably the most reliable place to get them is [here on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/pip/university-20/)
