I have a new PC, and both my bluetooth dongle and mp3 player no longer work; some problem or other with the USB ports. So I’ve upgraded to Ubuntu. I can no longer recover from standby or hibernate mode without a hard reset (possibly because I’m using the proprietary fglrx drivers for my ATI card rather than the free radeon ones) but that’s a small price to pay.

Skimming through [Mark’s subscriptions](http://feeds.diveintomark.org/) I saw [an article from Debian Package of the Day](http://debaday.debian.net/2007/01/28/agave-design-colour-schemes-the-easy-way/) which looked quite useful for what I’m doing at work. It included the application name, so I quickly dropped to gnome-terminal using [Deskbar](http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/), typed `apt-get install agave`, pressed “Y” and voila, there it was in my Applications menus listed under “Graphics”, exactly where I expected it to be. It just doesn’t get much easier than that.
