Anyway, I really, really like Ubuntu. I got a terrible virus/worm in January (I was warned, and disregarded it. Never again.)

I dual boot now but only because I don’t like any of the linux alternatives to the iPod’s firmware. (Don’t belive the hype. Amarok is good, but it’s no itunes.)

What I like about Ubuntu is this: It may not work somtimes, but it never works \_against\_ me."

Fortunately for me, I completely despise iTunes, so Amarok is a welcome relief – it probably helps that I don’t own at iPod 😉

This is my third attempt at switching to Ubuntu (I ran Mandrake in a former life), and it’s so far going better than previously."

I’ve got three boxes I use daily running with it, and I’ve never had any problems with normal hardware (my old Thinkpad gave me a challenge because the PCMCIA network card I have wasn’t supported in the install until 6.06 came along).

Regarding iPod firmware, Gabe – have you tried Rockbox? I’m a convert, I’ve ditched the Apple iTunesDB altogether now. (I’m with Pip, iTunes is horrid.)"

Pip&gt; Yes your problem will be with the Proprietary ATI drivers. Are they easy to install for you?"
1041,2007-02-03T13:21:00+00:00,"Phil Wilson",,,comment,0,"Yes, they were very easy to install. I’ve since installed the free ones, but Beryl stopped even working, so I’ve gone back to the non-free ones.

I think the problem is actually Beryl. Using either of the drivers, I can shutdown from within Metacity A-OK. But from Beryl I have to logout, \*then\* shutdown."

My friend using Suse says he gets much better frame rates than previously (2000 fps faster?!). If their are updates it might be worth cheching for you.

Sorry I dont know much about this issue because my ATI card at home is so old it is best supported by the open source driver. IE it doesn’t do much 🙂"
