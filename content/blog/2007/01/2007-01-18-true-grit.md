At the weekend we went to see [The Last King of Scotland](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455590/), a film about the reign of [Idi Amin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_amin) in Uganda (hint: hundreds of thousands of people died); a few days earlier we’d been to see [Pan’s Labyrinth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/), a fantasy set to the backdrop of Spain in the early days of [Franco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco)‘s rule (hint: Spanish dictator, mass graves).

After the film, which ended with a scene of torture, my wife turned to me and said “That’s it, next week we’re seeing a romantic comedy”; before I could reply a woman walking past with a harrowed expression on her face nodded and replied “I know just what you mean”.
