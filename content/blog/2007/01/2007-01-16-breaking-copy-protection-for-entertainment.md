I was saving this for Friday, because I thought it might be fun to post to my blog on a Friday, but Mark has [just posted](http://diveintomark.org/), essentially, my content x 10.

So, in summary, much like [the other Mark](http://iamsparticus.com/)‘s [comment ](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/12/18/merry_drmma/#c034328)on [Dave Shea’s related thread](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/12/18/merry_drmma) I bought my wife [Peep Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep_Show_%28TV_series%29) series 3 on DVD for Christmas (for the non-Brits, this is not what you think). It doesn’t play in our desktop computer or her laptop, and most certainly doesn’t play in our DVD player (which is a first-gen PlayStation 2).

In fact, I initially took it back to the shop and got a replacement, simply assuming the disc had been poorly authored only to find our replacement disc was faulty in exactly the same way.

The back of the box does actually indicate that, amongst other forms of protection, it’s protected by Macrovision’s [RipGuard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RipGuard#RipGuard) and this is what stops it from playing. To put this in context, we own well over 250 DVDs, and have never had any problems playing any of them in any of our devices. Now, our legally-bought DVD doesn’t play in our legally-bought DVD players. Let’s just check [Macrovision’s website](http://www.macrovision.com/products/activereach_dvd/ripguard/index.shtml):

> Only Macrovision can guarantee RipGuard DVD playability on all PC and consumer electronic DVD players. Our DVD certification process for Macrovision ACP includes testing and certifying every DVD device, before and after market release.

Hm, you’d have thought that a six-year old DVD playback device which has sold [over 110 million units](http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps2_e.html) might be included in that.

We decided to give Macrovision and Channel 4 a chance and sent them both an email asking how we were supposed to watch our new DVD. It’s been over 10 working days now, and we’ve not had any response, so I’ve used a “modern DVD ripping program \[to\] easily auto-detect and auto-bypass all of these protection schemes, and then re-author the disc onto ultra-cheap recordable media with no protection whatsoever” and we can now watch our DVD.

Dear Channel4 and Macrovision, you’ve just forced me to rip my own DVD in order to watch it. What’s wrong with this picture?
