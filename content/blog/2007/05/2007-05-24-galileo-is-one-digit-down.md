I went to Florence in April and saw not only [Galileo‚Äôs tomb](http://flickr.com/photos/pip/465336769/in/set-72157600095318292/) and [his first famous telescope](http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/esplora/cannocchiale/indice.html) but also his embalmed finger in a jar. Sadly, photos weren‚Äôt allowed üôÅ
