I haven’t really used Second Life that much, and I don’t really intend to, but there seems [to have been a real-life conference](http://technorati.com/tag/efsym2007) the other day which ran in parallel to one in Second Life and it made me leave a comment [on someone’s writeup, ](http://blog.paulwalk.net/2007/05/13/eduserv-symposium-2007-virtual-worlds-real-learning/)which I thought I’d repost here, because what’s a weblog for if not making you look stupid?

I’m pretty cynical of SL in general (let alone in education) and the claims that Linden make, but as a tool for easily creating 3D objects in a virtual world with a global population it really is unparalleled. At XTech, [Matt Biddulph gave a demo](http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000105.html) of how you can use real-life input to control items in SL. From what I understand, it should work the other way around too, giving a global audience the ability to affect say, something on your desk by ringing your doorbell in SL. Anything that gives that kind of opportunity is worthy of investigation at least.
