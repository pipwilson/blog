What [we’re](http://wiki.bath.ac.uk/display/bucswebdev/Home) trying to do at work:

- test-driven development
- pair programming
- implementation docs on the wiki
- code coverage stats (with [cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/)) regularly generated via…
- continuous integration (at the moment with [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/), soon to move to [Bamboo](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/))
- rapid software iterations (we suck at this right now)
- totally transparent group activity

I think we’re doing quite well on these things, but I wonder if it looks different from the outside?
