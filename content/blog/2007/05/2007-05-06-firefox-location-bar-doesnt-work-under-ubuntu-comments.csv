Set layout.word\_select.stop\_at\_punctuation to true.

Oh and btw, if you are still wondering about the flash and greasemonkey problems you wrote about a while back, check my comment: <http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/03/things-i-cant-do-in-firefox-without.html#6034922099684275089>

Keep up the good work on the blog, I really enjoyed your wife’s poem."

However it’s still a completely bizarre option for the Ubuntu build to set by default (reproduced on three other machines so it’s not just me), and I found it very hard to search anything that might have been related.

I’ll try harder to come up with things that bother me in the future 🙂"
