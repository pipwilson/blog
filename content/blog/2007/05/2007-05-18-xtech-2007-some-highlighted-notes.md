- [Joost](http://www.joost.com/) is based on standards all the way and the application forms a single DOM
- Henri’s [HTML5 conformance checker](http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker) generated some excitable debate about the inclusion of a normative (or even informative, if I remember properly) in the Atom spec
- The W3C are crazy
- [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) are about to sell a whole [mountain of kit](http://tinker.it/) thanks to [Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com/)
- [Alf Eaton](http://hublog.hubmed.org) is very tall
- There are more Welsh speakers in the world than Klingon, but only just (thanks [Ralph](http://ralphm.net/) and [Suw](http://strange.corante.com/) for helping us clear that one up)

More to come, I’m sure.
