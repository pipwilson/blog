I set up a few private wikis during my time at Bath and they proved invaluable for project work – far more useful than e-mailing Word documents back and forth. This would have been way easier if there had been a tool that let me create a private wiki and allow the people in my group to sign in to it by listing their OpenIDs when I created it."

We do have <http://wiki.bath.ac.uk> and students can use these to their hearts’ content (we’re coding up custom group creation to plug in right now), which uses normal Bath accounts. I don’t see what benefit OpenID would bring to either of these."
