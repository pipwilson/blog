Some of the more complex syntax rules I have seen at various Wiki’s are almost as difficult to remember for un-initiated users as HTML tags.

They also create a similar amount of visual clutter as standard HTML. So why not stick to a stripped down HTML subset for all the formating rules?

Or even better – use xml for all formating, and then apply formating via css."
