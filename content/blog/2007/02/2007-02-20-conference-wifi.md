Two of my workmates are currently at the [Future of Web Apps](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/) conference in London.

Not only have they had to pay for their wifi (which they were using to update a page on our wiki with details of the talks) but the connection is terrible: very slow and keeps dropping – they’ve given up trying to use it, despite having already paid. That’s pretty bad.

Maybe someone should tell the event organisers that the future of web apps probably involves working internet connections?

By the way, the wifi at Apachecon EU 2006 was free, always-on and brilliantly useful.
