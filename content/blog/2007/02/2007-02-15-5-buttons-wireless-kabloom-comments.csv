I was toying with the idea of a Frogpad before Christmas (left hand words, right hand pointing)but the price tag and the lack of available left handed models (not sure why, but they were in short supply) put me off.

a colleague’ got a nifty scroll wheel beside her numerics on her keyboard so she can drift up and down lines of code using the base of her hand.

If you’re suffering aches and pains I can highly recommend a mouse bean in the short term. Take care!"

I’ve found a little application called “Launchy” for WInXP that all but eliminates mousing. Try it. It’s fantastic.

Ubuntu, ironicially, given Linux’s command-line heritage, does not seem as easily made mouse-free these days."

I never really liked trackpads on laptops, but for what I use my iBook for (a lot of browsing and simple writing) the trackpad works well, and I don’t even miss the mouse."

I bought a wireless mouse when I got the laptop but I realise i’m usually happy to use the nipple thingy which is conveniently located for my hands on the keyboard. My trackball is new and I don’t know how to set it up to allow easy scrolling, which is a real pain 🙂

At home I am experimenting with a trackball, this has the advantage of no arm movement, no mouse lifting. However I suspect the best thing for at home would be to have a lower desk position so I’m not sure this is a good test 🙂

I would like to experiment with a pen as a pointing device.

I think eye tracking technology would be useful to build into the computer, even if it was only able to tell which screen I was looking at this would be useful most of the time 🙂

Imagine how little information needs to be communicated to scroll a page. There has to be a better way.

Maybe we should have foot peddles too 🙂"

I find the nipples are a pain and you end up with a tense finger as some of them need a (relatively speaking) hard push which puts tension on the finger all the time – this was the case on my old laptop.

Having said all that, using an external mouse on a laptop is cheating."
