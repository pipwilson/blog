[Mark](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/02/19/links-for-2007-02-19)‘s linked to [David Pashley’s ogg player roundup](http://www.davidpashley.com/blog/2007/02/18#ogg-player-redux "ogg player redux"). For what it’s worth, I’ve been looking into this recently too, except I had some additional restrictions which, given the players David puts on show, leaves me with only one choice (which was the one I’d previously selected in my own research): the Samsung YP-U2 (1GB for [£61](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-YP-U2W-1GB-UltraSlim-Player/dp/B000ES178M/sr=8-13/qid=1171915281/ref=pd_ka_13/026-3687096-9094838?ie=UTF8&s=electronics) or 2GB for, er, [£58](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-YP-U2R-UltraSlim-Player-Radio/dp/B000IOMUK6/sr=8-9/qid=1171915281/ref=pd_ka_9/026-3687096-9094838?ie=UTF8&s=electronics)).

My additional restrictions were:

- rechargeable internal battery
- must not need cable to connect to PC

The player I’d be replacing is the [Creative Zen Nano Plus 1GB](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Zen-Nano-Plus-1GB/dp/B000A3P3WM/ref=pd_sim_ce_1/026-3687096-9094838) which I’d give three stars for general alright-ness.

Whether I can actually justify spending ~£60 on a new player which will only give me a minor playing upgrade (only a few tens of tracks in my 20GB compressed-format music collection are in ogg) and some usability benefits (no more lugging a mini-USB cable and spare batteries around) is yet to be seen.

In fact, looking back, I’ve been wanting this player since[ June 2006](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pip/163218476/). This is reasonably depressing – does this really mean there have been no new decent ogg-capable players for at least eight months?
