A mental reminder to check first whether [a new owner](http://www.google.com) provides RSS feeds [for searches](http://video.google.co.uk/videofeed?type=search&q=%22university+of+bath%22&so=1&num=20&output=rss) in [a service they’ve just bought](http://www.youtube.com) before learning [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Rubyful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/RubyfulSoup/) and [Feedtools](http://sporkmonger.com/projects/feedtools/) and writing your own parser.

There’s two hours I’m not getting back.
