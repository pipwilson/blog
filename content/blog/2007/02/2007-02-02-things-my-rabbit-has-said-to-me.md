My rabbit’s been chatting merrily away now that [his chat form](http://philwilson.org/rabbit/) is up. Some highlights from the past few weeks:

- Message from [doozer](http://arsecandle.org/~rod/nt/) : In the future, all world knowledge will be communicated through talking rabbits.
- Message from [Piro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatokyo#Piro) – [Megatokyo.com](http://megatokyo.com/) : Phil, check out my website, I finally figured out how to get the story moving, and now things are happening at last…
- Message from [Chris Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_%28game_designer%29) : Buy [Supreme Commander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander)
- Message from [meeper](http://bainite.wordpress.com/) : meep!
- Message from Nabaztag Mothership. : Nabaztag unite! It’s time to begin phase 2.
- Message from Anonymous : Oh my God, I’m so cute!
- Message from Dave : AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!! OHHH MY GOOD THE PAIN THE PAIN!!! AAAAAAAAAAHH
- Anonymous: I just can’t wait for the week-end

Many thanks everyone (especially Piro, I don’t think I’ve read MegaTokyo for about a year now, plenty of catching up to do). And yes, I probably will be getting Supreme Commander. [Carry on.](http://philwilson.org/rabbit/)
