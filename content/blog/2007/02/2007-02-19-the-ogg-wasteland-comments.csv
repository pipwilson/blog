My ridiculous-looking 20gb Archos, which must be half a decade old, finally began to exhibit the burnt-out solder power leak of doom. I too have been looking into replacement options. Though I’ve been looking for something hard-disk based, I share your incredulity. I’d thought that by now there’d be tens of possible players, many of which would offer Ogg as an option. Not only is this emphatically not the case, but on top of the lack of Ogg or Flac-ness, there’s insult heaped onto injury by the bizarre urge most manufacturers share to require the use of ridiculous proprietary indexing software.

Why? Why?? Just treat it as an USB mass storage device!

Sadly, I think my options are limited to: another Archos, a Cowon iAudio, or some bizarre el cheapo Chinese no-name brand. Disappointed 🙁"

Comparison [here](http://dapreview.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.273).

I’m very satisfied with this one for over a year and it’s quite cheap these days."

I’ll have a closer look though, thanks for the pointer!"
