Wifi was planned, as it was last year, but something went wrong at the very last minute with the telco so it didn’t arrive this morning. The wifi equipment is set up but no fat pipe to deliver the web. Ryan (the organiser) is upset and annoyed but powerless to do anything. This leaves the venue’s own BT Openzone which simply isn’t up to the punishment a roomful of webbies can deliver."

It doesn’t matter how it’s gone wrong, or how upset Ryan is; for the paying attendees it’s a shambles."

You realise this is a blog, right?"

It’s got to be said though that one thing that you can’t afford to get wrong at a conference for web developers is providing wifi.

The problem is that we were told at the beginning of the day that we had to pay for access. I didn’t know any better so I paid for 2 BT Openzone vouchers. In the middle of the day we were told that it wasn’t up to the job for the number of people attending, unfortunately I had discovered this for myself by this time.

If we had been told about the telco problems at the start of the day I might have stuck with wikipad to take notes.

I understand Ryan was probably trying to sort it out and hoped we would be up and running by lunchtime but I think it would have been better to let everyone know as early as possible.

I feel bad about being so negative as it really was a good conference despite these problems.

I would be interested to know who was supposed to be providing the wifi……."
