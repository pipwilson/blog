Bristol will be holding [its first-ever BarCamp](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/242037/) this year on Friday October 12th and Saturday 13th. It costs a fiver to sign up, and the first rule of Barcamp is that if you are attending BarCamp, you **must** present.

[The wiki page with all the information is here](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBristol), and links through to payment details. Sign up!

I have no idea what I can talk about. [My Arduino](http://flickr.com/photos/pip/1054979034/) maybe? XMPP? I don’t really know anything – PVR/media shifting and how it filters to consumers? I’m going to guess that the audience will mostly be non-heavy techie. Any ideas?
