Let’s see, they [convert everything to Atom](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/10/atom-from-any-rss-feed-via-google.html) and have just added the only two features I was missing: [search and “hide feed list”](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/we-found-it.html) (I do a lot of feed reading on a tablet).

It even goes offline, has a mobile version and some great keyboard shortcuts, including a nice SHIFT+/. How can you go wrong?
