Since I am too lazy to manage my own subscriptions, I was subscribed to [Planet Intertwingly](http://planet.intertwingly.net). At 269 feeds though, the signal/noise ratio has taken a bad hit (what do you mean Sam doesnâ€™t tailor his blogroll for me personally?) and Iâ€™m going to have to actually import [the OPML](http://planet.intertwingly.net/opml.xml) and weed out stuff Iâ€™m not interested in. How annoying.

I strongly recommend any other subscribers tired of my witterings to do the same thing and remove me ðŸ˜‰
