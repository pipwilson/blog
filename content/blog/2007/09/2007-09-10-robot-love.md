Even after [Luis Villa’s latest paean](http://tieguy.org/blog/2007/09/08/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-roomba-overlords/), I am genuinely not sure whether I could [buy a Roomba](http://store.irobot.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2501652). The thought of it slowly making its way from room to room whilst I’m at work just scares me slightly. Would you still feel as though your house had been invaded if it had been burgled, but by a robot?
