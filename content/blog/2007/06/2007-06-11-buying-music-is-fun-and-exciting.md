I’ve just bought my first ever digital-only album. It was “We are the Pipettes” by, erm, [The Pipettes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pipettes).

I actually bought it via last.fm, after listening to their tracks through the embedded last.fm player, who redirect through to [7digital](https://www.7digital.com/), who, once I’d registered and paid my £7.99, offered to let me download each track in either WMA, AAC or mp3 (Amazon are charging either [£4.47](http://www.amazon.co.uk/We-Are-Pipettes/dp/B000FS9L2K/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/026-8086840-7730829?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1181576349&sr=8-1) or [£11.99](http://www.amazon.co.uk/We-Are-Pipettes/dp/B000GHEAPS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/026-8086840-7730829?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1181576349&sr=8-2) for the physical disk, depending on who you believe).

In order to download the entire album in one go I had to install some software on my local PC (currently Windows-only), but it was a breeze to install and let me download my mp3s in a matter of mere moments. There doesn’t even appear to be any DRM in the files and I’ve been playing them happily on my Ubuntu machine. This is how things are supposed to be.

The album’s great by the way.
