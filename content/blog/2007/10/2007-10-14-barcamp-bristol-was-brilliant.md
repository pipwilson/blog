The first [Barcamp Bristol](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBristol) ran on Friday evening and all-day Saturday and was completely ace.

Many many thanks to [Laura](http://ledastray.co.uk/), [Alex](http://alexfrancis.org.uk/) and [Tim](http://www.timandkathy.co.uk/journal/) for doing the organising and for pulling together such a great mix of people, talks and pure fun!

My talk, ‚ÄúA very personal webserver‚Äù, was about [the port Nokia have made of Apache2 to the Symbian OS](http://wiki.opensource.nokia.com/projects/Mobile_Web_Server) ‚Äì that is to say, you can now run a webserver from your phone and use their port of Python plus mod\_python (and a number of other modules) to expose any data already on your phone to the outside world over HTTP. I‚Äôll make another post about it, but for now [my slides are on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/pip/a-very-personal-web-server) and I‚Äôll put the original OpenOffice Impress file up here, too.

As is traditional we played Werewolf, three rounds, but there weren‚Äôt many of us playing so I ended up as a Seer (throat ripped out), then a Werewolf (killed by a baying mob), and a Werewolf again (feasted on villagers ‚Äòtil the end of time). Many thanks to [Pete](http://petef.org/) for, I strongly suspect, throwing the last game for the sake of sportsmanship üôÇ

Anyway, I got to meet lots of bright, local people, learn lots of new things, and drink free beer. I‚Äôm not really sure how it could have been any better.

There are loads of [photos on Flickr tagged with ‚Äúbarcampbristol‚Äù](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/barcampbristol/) (I‚Äôm the one in the bright red tee).
