[This is a stupid Greasemonkey script](http://philwilson.org/code/greasemonkey/bbcpodcasts2opml.user.js "bbc podcasts to OPML") which looks at a BBC podcast listings page and generates an OPML file. It’s a 20 minute hack and so is hard-coded for the Radio 4 podcasts – another five minutes should fix this. For the time being, [try it out here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/directory/station/radio4/).

I wanted to be able to import the file into my N95 so that I could browse them and import the ones I wanted. It seems to have done the job.
