My wife’s not been sleeping well recently.

Phil Wilson is a geek snob  
Web app programming is his day job  
Linux is his OS  
Firefox and the rest  
Cos he thinks that Bill Gates is a nob

Phil Wilson he likes to pretend  
Open source software’s his friend  
“DRM sucks!” he cries  
But it’s really all lies  
The licence he’s too cheap to spend

Phil Wilson bangs on about wiki  
But one bit is really quite tricky  
Anybody can edit  
And Phil takes the credit  
If it’s wrong then he looks like a thickie

Phil Wilson he is a trend-setter  
With flashy gadgets he is a go-getter  
Lots of buttons and shiny  
They must also be tiny  
(The one time where the smaller the better.)

Phil Wilson is sharp as a knife  
The best looking I’ve seen in my life  
Boyish charm and good hair  
and he dresses with flair,  
He made me write this, I’m his wife.
