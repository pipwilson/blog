I’m sure someone could come up with a plugin that would allow it. As for Greasemonkey usage, maybe hacking the Chrome gubbins would allow it?"

I was expecting that F6 would work, but it doesn’t. Once your tab focus is inside a Flash widget, it’s trapped forever. Lame.

Yes, some Chrome gubbins would allow it (I suppose there might already be a keyboard shortcut that I just don’t know about), but it should be part of the base install."

You can, however, shift-tab (backwards) out of one. [Bug 190513](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190513) (opened Jan 2003)."

 <http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/keyconfig>

You can add a bit of js to make the change to nsIPrefService.

var prefs = Components.classes\[“@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1”\].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPrefService);  
prefs = prefs.getBranch(“greasemonkey.”);  
prefs.setBoolPref(“enabled”, !prefs.getBoolPref(“enabled”));

Let me know if you need more help with keyconfig.

In regards to the flash issue, one thing I have found that helps quite a bit is the flashblock extension:

<http://flashblock.mozdev.org/>

This prevents flash from trapping your keypresses, and mouse wheel scrolling."

I consider this to be a serious usability issue."

Tends to make me wonder how a bug of this sort can be left for this long."
