Unlike [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal/1265), I couldn’t care less about giving people a nice web interface onto what I’ve been doing. I’d much rather have a view onto what people I know have been doing instead.

A web view of what I’ve been doing is in fact probably the **least interesting thing you could possibly do**.

He briefly mentioned portable social networks. Well, those aren’t going to work until the services we use start actually providing full import and export. Maybe with the advent of services becoming OpenID providers (even if it is [via a proxy](http://idproxy.net/)) we’ll see a way to create accounts for your contacts without them having to actually do anything and thereby a way to move transparently between services. As if.

I’ve just remembered that the first thing I did with [Jeremy’s original lifestream code](http://adactio.com/journal/1202/) was add OPML support and then use Leigh Dodds’ “[Subscribe to my brain](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000218.html)” service to create an OPML file listing my account subscriptions. No work from me and a full lifestream, that’s great, notably because it gives me a quick ‘in’ to the contact lists of those services. I’ll dig out my code tomorrow, but anyone could write it in a couple of minutes.
