Using it now.

You can also embed the icon in the python extension, by base64-encoding it and loading at runtime. Also since 2.18 deskbar supports installing by drag and dropping a .py link to the prefs panel and it gets installed automatically. Finally, you should probably add a simple config dialog to store the twitter username and password.

Very nice work !"

Yes, you’re right about the preferences, but I was too lazy 🙂"

Secondly, i get (after some python traceback calls) the following error rule after I started the python script “setup.py test”:  
pkg\_resources.DistributionNotFound: simplejson&gt;=1.5

What should I do, easy\_setup cannot be installed through the repo?

TIA!"

@mithras86:

Try this:  
wget [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez\_setup.py](http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py)

sudo python ez\_setup.py

sudo easy\_install -U simplejson

That should take care of the dependencies.

Best Regards"

Please note you point to the icon “twitter.png”, but provided an icon called “deskbar-twitter.png”, so you should change one of them to get the icon working.

But furthermore: this is really cool, i’ll post it at forums i’m visiting very often!"

I don’t use Twitter but I like the concept, and your tool is perfect

However, I don’t think everybody wants to go through installing that lib (unless there are distro packages),  
so I made my own version using only HTTP methods (which are included by default I think)

anyway here is it  
[  ](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=554874)<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=554874>

it’s still far from perfect but I tried it and it worked

Again very nice tool, I think I’ll give this twitter thing a try 🙂"
