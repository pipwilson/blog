[Individual](http://www.joedolson.com/articles/2007/03/new-w3c-html-working-groupbut-who-cares/ "Individual") [developers](http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?2007/03/08/3292-html-wg-2007 "developers") [don’t care](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/03/10/Lever-of-Archimedes "don't care") (or at least, understand the practical issues it brings up), but being able to turn around to my workmates and going “Look, HTML isn’t dead, even the W3C have faced up to it” carries a lot of weight. Yes, it’s a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority "logical fallacy"), but that doesn’t really matter. If you’re trying to convince your boss or someone higher up the chain that maybe XHTML isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and might just introduce more problems than they think, then this is a nice heavy rock to throw.
