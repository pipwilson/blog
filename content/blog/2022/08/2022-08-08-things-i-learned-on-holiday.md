1. My DVD rip of [The Devil Wears Prada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)) includes the closed-caption audio and not the regular audio
2. A Chromebook is a perfectly reasonable development device using the built-in Linux support – git, Sublime Code and my particular build toolchain all worked fine
3. [Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)) is actually quite good. Who knew?
4. If you go to the [most middle-class service station in the UK](https://gloucesterservices.com/farmshop/) you can buy a terrible sandwich plushie for the low, low price of just £25
