If you‘re subscribed to [my RSS feed](http://philwilson.org/rssify.php) then STOP! Move to [my Atom feed](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/atom.xml).

My RSS feed doesn’t have proper titles, doesn’t tell you when items were published and is the result of five minutes of PHP.

I won’t be turning it off any time soon, but please—think of the children.
