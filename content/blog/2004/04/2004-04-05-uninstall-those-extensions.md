It’s a doddle to install firefox extensions but near impossible to uninstall them unless you know what you’re doing, and if you’re like me, you’ll see a new extension and go “Oooh, that looks good”, install it and before you know it have twenty installed of which you use about five.

However there’s one extension you should definitely grab: the [extension uninstaller](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Firefox_:_FAQs_:_Uninstall_Extensions)! Yes now you too can uninstall all those unused extensions that you once thought would brighten up your daily browsing experience with the click of a single button!
