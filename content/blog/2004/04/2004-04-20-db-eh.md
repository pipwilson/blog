I don’t pretend to be a DBA but currently at work that’s part of my role (what was that sa password again?).

Anyway, the [Java Performance Tuning website](http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/) has a recent Question of the Month which just happens to deal with [primary key efficiency in SQL Server](http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/news/qotm040.shtml) – well worth a read.
