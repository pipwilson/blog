Hot damn! Mozilla RDF has a new module owner who has this to say:

> We gonna push for both standards conformance (there are new specs out there since early 2004) and scriptability for remote web applications. This will include some serious whacking of the RDF API in Mozilla, as that is not ready for the web by a fair amount.

Great! I’ve run into a couple of issues that would benefit from the RDF module following the latest spec version, and we can only guess at what “scriptability for remote web applications” will allow us to do.
