It seems I’m not the only one who’s been busy. [G](http://www.xurble.org) has written a lovely little [AudioScrobbler plugin for iTunes/Windows](http://www.xurble.org/itunes/iScrobbler.php) which means that audioscrobbler is now available on all of the most common music players available for Windows machines. Woohoo!
