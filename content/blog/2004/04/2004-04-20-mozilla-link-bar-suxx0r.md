The Mozilla link toolbar doesn’t work as well as [Firefox’s link toolbar extension](http://cdn.mozdev.org/linkToolbar/) does. For about a year now I’ve had `rel="bookmark"` on the permanent links to my posts, and these have quite merrily appeared in Firefox’s link toolbar, and I’ve just added `rel="section"` to links to my monthly archives, and these also appear nicely

But neither of these appear as menu options in Mozilla 1.7b (build 2004031616 if you care). Rubbish!
