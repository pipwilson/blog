[wireframe](http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~ibueno/wireframe.html) (via [CSSVault](http://9rules.com/cssvault/) via [Whitespace](http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/)) is an exceptionally good list of CSS demonstrations, many of which really blew me away ([Beehemoth](http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~ibueno/vault/beehemoth.html) in particular). They demonstrate what the power and flexibility of CSS – there’s no way you could replicate these kinds of layout using tables and retain the usability of the underlying HTML.  
These are definitely worth looking at for anyone even vaguely interested in CSS-based design and layout.
