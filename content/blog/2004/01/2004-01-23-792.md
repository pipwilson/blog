[BBC to arm journalists with mobile video phones](http://rcrnews.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?newsId=16628)

Interesting stuff. I wonder if theyâ€™ll be using off-the-shelf phones that you and I could get our hands on? I also wonder how theyâ€™re planning to send their videos through to the studio â€“ youâ€™d think that if they donâ€™t have access to their video camera, theyâ€™re not going to have access to their satellite. ðŸ™‚

On a more sinister note, I wonder if this will become the de facto covert reporting tool for a little while, at least until the junta being investigated discovers it of courseâ€¦
