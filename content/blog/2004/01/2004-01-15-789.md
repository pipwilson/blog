From on [Robert Scoble’s post about meeting with the head of the IE team](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/14.html#a6183) comes a link to [jeffdav’s weblog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffdav) – Jeff is a member of the IE UI team! The first IE-team blogger? Looks like it, and it looks like it’s going to be a good read.

(there’s also [a follow up to Robert’s original post](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/categories/scobleizer/2004/01/14.html#a6186))
