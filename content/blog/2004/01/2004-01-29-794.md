Blogging on the breakfast news, not often that happens, but it happened today when [Dominic Holland](http://www.dominicholland.com/) (stand-up comedian, writer and part-time host of HIGNFY) was talking about his new book, which apparently has something to do with football, which of course, everyone loves. And some geek \*cough\* ardent fan offered to set up some kind of blog about it. Dominic was very excited and started getting very animated about this new-fangled interweb thing.

Maybe this means he might one day object to his own website being absolutely atrocious.
