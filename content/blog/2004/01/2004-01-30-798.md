Itâ€™s interesting to note the slow but inexorable march of blog-content on the BBC website. First of all there was the [Scotblog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/webguide/scotblog/) and then more famously the [reportersâ€™ log during the Iraq war](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2866547.stm). Now (and since who knows when) thereâ€™s the [Gamesblog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/games/gamesblog/) which is just what you think it is. ðŸ™‚

In addition, more and more viewer-written pieces are appearing in blog form such as the [Blog of a non-smoker](http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/your_space/features/stop_smoking.shtml).

When you couple this with the fact that you can run your own weblog on the [BBC Collective](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective) site, I think itâ€™s fair to conclude that the BBC has gone utterly weblog-crazy. ðŸ™‚

Does this mean anything in a social networking, cutting-edge weblogging, lowering-the-boundaries-to-personal-publishing, acceptance of blogging-as-a-form-of-legitimate-journalism kind of way?

Probably not.
