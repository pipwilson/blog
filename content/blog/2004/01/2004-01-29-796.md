I recently started a new job at [Zoo Digital Group](http://www.zoodigitalgroup.com/), employed as a Java and Web developer. There are a few other Java developers here (although the main trade-in-stock is C++), but I’m now the web development department. Me.

This is actually quite good, and I’ve enjoyed the work I’ve had to do so far, but now a couple of others have had to start putting web pages together, and without my expert guidance (read: slap to the back of the head), there are tables-for-layout, font tags and all sorts lying around. How am I supposed to teach, quickly, how to do layouts with CSS? Well, [Colored boxes](http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/process/index.cfm) an article from MaxDesign (whom [I linked to recently](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2004_01_01_blog.html#107416276770579773) for their all-round top-notch tutorials) does just that. Eleven easy steps and even includes print style sheets! What more could a man ask for? Oh, apart from his girlfriend/wife/dog wearing the [HTTP 200 – OK knickers](http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/valentines/6796/) of course (via [Charles](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/)).
