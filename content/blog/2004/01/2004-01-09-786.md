Holy crap! Iâ€™m not dead! Hope everyone had a lovely Christmas, and a Happy New Year (and other capitalisations).

Mid-December, I successfully trashed the server that hosts all of the resources this site uses (rss, images etc.). Finally back up now.

Then it was my holiday, then I changed job. Goodbye lameass [ibase](http://www.ibase.com) and hello new lord and master [Zoo](http://www.zoodigitalgroup.com).

Yesterday Leigh wrote a bit about [lazy photo annotation](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000108.html), and mentioned my [RDF skin for JAlbum](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_12_01_blog.html#107096491305695251).

Leighâ€™s entry reminded me that my skin is still quite lacking in a few areas, some of which he and I spoke about via email at the time and others of which I have still to resolve. Since then though, the skin now publishes:

- an image index with links to each image
- an RDF index with links to the describing RDF file for each image
- each image separately
- each RDF image annotation file separately containing image details such as dimensions, comment, creation time/date and co-depiction

I donâ€™t describe location, nor keywords like [Bryce does in his MT photo annotation template](http://tenyearsof.us/meta/2003/12/27/rdf_photo_annotation_with_movable_type) mainly because a) Iâ€™m not happy with the current means of location description and b) Iâ€™m lazy and wordnet is just too much effort.

Itâ€™s my birthday at the weekend, so I shanâ€™t get time to finish my photo annotations then, but as soon as I can, I will, and publish with all the new data. Itâ€™s a shame I didnâ€™t bump into anyone FOAFy in Bristol, it would have been nice to be linked in to the co-depiction club. ðŸ™‚
