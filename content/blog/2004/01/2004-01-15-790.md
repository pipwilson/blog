[Newseum: The interactive museum of news](http://www.newseum.org/) provides a summary of [today’s front pages](http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/) from 274 different newspapers from 36 different countries. There are only three from the UK (the [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk), [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk) and [Mirror](http://www.mirror.co.uk/)), but the breadth is amazing – how \*do\* they do it?
