[The Showroom](http://www.showroom.org.uk/) ([location](http://multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&db=pc&addr1=&client=public&addr2=&advanced=&addr3=&pc=S12BX&quicksearch=S1+2BX&cidr_client=none))cinema and bar in Sheffield provides free WiFi access to all customers in its bar, and is only a two minute walk from my apartment.

Now all I need is a laptop with wifi ðŸ˜‰
