> Bottom line is I don’t normally like frameworks. But I like Tapestry.

This is what I typically hear from people who use [Tapestry](http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/). It’s an awesome flexible Java application framework which uses the concept of reusable componenets throughout the entire system. It scales well, deals with internationalisation easily, has masses of code reuse because of the components and has great error reporting. Some people have compared the way it works with the fundamentals behind Swing, and they’re not necessarily far wrong. What **is** true is that its learning curve is much steeper than that of other Java frameworks I’ve used (ok, *was*, when I was learning it about 18 months ago), but [the mailing list](http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail2.html#tapestry "The Tapestry mailing list") support is excellent, there’s [an active wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tapestry/ "The Tapestry Wiki"), and the lead developer, Howard Lewis-Ship has published a book (as well as [having a blog](http://howardlewisship.com/blog/ "Howard Lews-Ship's blog")), so there’s no real excuse to not at least take a look.
