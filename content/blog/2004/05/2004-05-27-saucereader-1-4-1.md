[SauceReader](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/) recently went to 1.4.1 and with it comes MS Messenger integration ([described more fully here](http://www.synop.com/Weblogs/Nathan/PermaLink.aspx?guid=36e9890c-7632-4796-959f-6d84b7f6eea3) but you can get per-user feeds for other people that are using SauceReader and if not then it’ll just send a message with the item title and link), better memory usage and the clearing up of several other issues (check the status on the [SauceReader weblog](http://www.synop.com/Weblogs/SauceReader/)!).

More importantly (hah!), their website now works in Firefox (although still not without its glitches!) and in particular the [screenshots page](http://www.synop.com/Products/SauceReader/Information/Demo/) is actually viewable! woohoo!

Interestingly, [Scoble just picked up on it](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/05/25.html#a7607) and since then [its picked up a whole host of links](http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.synop.com%2FProducts%2FSauceReader%2F&sub=Go%21)

SauceReader is good, it’s really starting to push the bounds of what we expect from a desktop aggregator (what with the Messenger integration and built-in blogging tool), and is rapidly becoming the answer to what I asked [last month](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/04/idle-sods.html)., although [when I first used it](http://www.synop.com/Support/newsgroups.php?article_id=39) I thought it was just going to become a simple aggregator like [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/). I’m glad it hasn’t.
