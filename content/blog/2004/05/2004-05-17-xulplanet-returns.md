[XULPlanet has returned!](http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/article/257) and thank god for that, really.

In case you donâ€™t know, [XULPlanet](http://www.xulplanet.com/) is *the* place to find out about how to write XUL apps for Mozilla and/or do cool stuff with the Mozilla interface (and this includes Firefox and Thunderbird) without resorting to reading the source code.

Last week one of my work mates asked me if I knew how he could write his own extension for Firefox; after a quick hand he ended up with a nice new, working extension and I pointed him at [XULPlanet](http://www.xulplanet.com/) if he needed to find out more. Except that it was gone, and I was left looking a buffoon.

Hurrah for the return of [XULPlanet](http://www.xulplanet.com/) and the saving of my non-foon reputation!
