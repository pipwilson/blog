> Is it just me, or does [RedHat’s Bugzilla Install](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/) put Mozilla’s to shame?

Yes it does. Bugzilla’s user interface, particularly the query page and individual bug pages are incredibly difficult to use until you’re used to them. There’s a real usability problem there.

If I ever have to use Bugzilla, I use [](http://bugxula.mozdev.org)Bugxula instead because it’s just so much easier.
