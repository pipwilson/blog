[Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) has [a new look](http://www.blogger.com/knowledge/2004/05/great-blogger-relaunch.pyra "The Great Blogger Relaunch").

Supports comments (including, it seems, a Typekey-style registration for all Blogger sites).

Supports per-post archives.

Support user profiles.

Has a massively increased tag templating system.

A **whole raft** of new, validating CSS-based templates by people like [Douglas Bowman](http://www.stopdesign.com/), [Dave Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com/), [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/), [Dan Rubin](http://www.superfluousbanter.org/), [Glish](http://www.glish.com/) and [Dan Cederholm](http://www.simplebits.com/). Amazing.

It successfully imported and modified my old template to use its new tags, and other than that, I’ll let you know how it goes. Suffice to say for the time being – *wow.*

Something I didn’t notice in the first five minutes was this: [How do I create a blog that Blogger will host for free?](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=28&topic=13). Maybe it was there all the time, but I didn’t know about it before – free site on BlogSpot!
