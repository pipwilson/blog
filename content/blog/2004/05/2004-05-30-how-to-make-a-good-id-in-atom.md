[How to make a good ID in Atom](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id) by Mark Pilgrim clears up one of the murkiest aspects of Atom for early adopters – how to generate a GUID for items in an Atom feed (well, it was murky for me at least).

As with the the rest of his how-to entries it’s clear, easy to understand and has a worked through example, allowing even dolts like me to get what he’s talking about. If you want to generate or parse Atom, you should read it.
