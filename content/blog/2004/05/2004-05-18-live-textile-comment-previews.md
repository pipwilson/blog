[Live textile comment previews](http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2004/05/18/preview).

Powered by javascript by [Stuart Langridge](http://www.kryogenix.org/), and [sneakily elicited by me](http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2004/05/17/showdomtreeii) this rocks my world.

I can’t *wait* for Stuart to make a real release. Until you’ve seen your Textile markup translated into HTML in real time, you haven’t lived.
