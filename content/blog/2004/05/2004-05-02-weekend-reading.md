Since I started using del.icio.us in a semi-serious way I realised that it’s most useful to me as a place to store links that I could a) potentially blog about or b) might need when I’m on a different machine.

Of course, all things being equal and despite my best intentions, I can’t really blog about all the things I save to del.icio.us and in lieu of a sidebar-linklog thing I present a small weekend reading list (yes I know it’s Sunday afternoon, but tomorrow’s a Bank Holiday so you’ve got plenty of time).

- [UK Postcode Coordinates](http://www.jibble.org/ukpostcodes/) (via [Jim](http://feetup.org/blog)) – I should probably link this in to [the UK Blogger Map](http://philwilson.org/ukbloggermap/) and the [full list of UK Bloggers by postcode](http://www.ukbloggers.com/fulllist/) to come up with a semi-complete map. Two versions maybe? Bigger version for zoomability?
- [RDFMapper](http://www.mapbureau.com/rdfmapper/) <q cite="http://www.mapbureau.com/rdfmapper/">searches an RDF or RSS file for resources with geographic locations, and returns a map overlayed with dots representing located resources.</q> Neat.
- A biased [Outlook 2003 vs. Thunderbird](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000118.html) comparison – I’ll leave it to you to let the author know where and how he’s wrong.
- [BBC Web Development Guidelines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/webdev/) – this is very interesting reading. Of particular interest is [Appendix E: Browser Support Standards](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/webdev/AppE.Browser_Support_Standards.htm) <q cite="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/webdev/">which provides details of what browsers must be supported by all bbc.co.uk pages</q> and says that Safari is only partially supported, and that there’s no need to test in it. Blimey.
- [Print CSS — table headers and footers](http://blog.vinniegarcia.com/oldstuff/000127.html) – an incredibly useful nugget of information about getting headers and footers to appear on multiple pages in CSS.
- [ZVON tabs and sidebars](http://www.zvon.org/Output/bar_list.html) – [for RSS Reader reasons](http://xurble.org/blog/article/13/) I was looking at sidebars again, and got depressed at how lame sidebars are in Firefox compared to Mozilla. I desperately want my F9 back.
