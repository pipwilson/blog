[JTextile 1.1 is out!](http://philwilson.org/code/jtextile/)

There have been a lot of changes in this version, and a massive amount of bug fixing (for the record, it doesnâ€™t suffer from any of [Textile4jâ€™s current bugs](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=566889&group_id=82232&func=browse)). Itâ€™s hugely reliable, fast, and easy to embed.

It makes use of the GNU regexp library so it can be used on 1.3 JVMs as well as 1.4 and above.

All-in-all, itâ€™s awesome. Get it now! ðŸ™‚
