del.icio.us provides you with a virtual inbox to which you can add any other usersâ€™ bookmark lists. You then have access to this inbox via RSS. So, for example, in [my del.icio.us inbox](http://del.icio.us/inbox/pip/) I effectively have the feeds for [blech](http://del.icio.us/blech), [yoz](http://del.icio.us/yoz), [kellan](http://del.icio.us/kellan), [msippey](http://del.icio.us/msippey) and [xurble](http://del.icio.us/xurble) all bundled into [one big feed](http://del.icio.us/inbox/rss/pip) with each item having an associated `dc:creator` to tell me who created each entry.

The problem I have with this is that I use [JabRSS](http://cmeerw.org/dev/node/view/7) for all my RSS and Atom needs, which does nothing with dc:creator at all, making it pretty much impossible for me to tell who posted which item.

I can smell a new Jabber-based aggregator in the air. ðŸ˜‰
