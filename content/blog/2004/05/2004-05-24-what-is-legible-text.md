One of the many sites I read linked to [findability.org](http://www.findability.org/faq.php) today. The thing is, whilst the people behind it may know a lot about findability, I‚Äôll never know because I can‚Äôt read their site. A nice light-grey text on a white background gives me so much trouble that I just won‚Äôt read it. I *could* spend some time [customising their site with my own CSS](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/04/awesome-per-site-css.html), but frankly, it‚Äôs more effort than it‚Äôs worth. My time is valuable, and if you‚Äôre not going to design yore site in such a way that I can read and navigate it effortlessly, then not only am I not going to stay on your site, I‚Äôm not even going to skim read it (other than to look for a style switcher).

Didier Hilhorst recently wrote [When Black Is Not Black](http://superfluousbanter.org/archives/000189.php), a piece on why you shouldn‚Äôt use black for website copy. It‚Äôs obviously a little tongue-in-cheek, and reveals an awful lot about designers (especially one so noted for his CSS skills), but is very telling. The thing I care about more than any other in design is that I can *read the text*. Really. I‚Äôm an end user, I‚Äôm no design genius. I won‚Äôt be told that the contrast on my monitor is all wrong (which has happened before), because frankly, everything on my computer except your site looks just great thank you very much.

The thing is, of course, that most designers hate black-on-white text. OK, I‚Äôm generalising, but look at the list of [the 80/20 design blogosphere](http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000010.html) and see how many use black on white text. Finished? Not many, was it? Of course the thing with legibility isn‚Äôt just about the choice of text and background colour; the font, its size and the line-spacing all contribute (typography in general deals with many other factors but most of these just aren‚Äôt available for change on the web). For example both [stopdesign](http://www.stopdesign.com/) and [Simplebits](http://www.simplebits.com/) have extremely legible sites with white background and non-black text (without looking it at their CSS, I‚Äôm guessing at about #666), mainly due to the large text and line-spacing, much larger, in fact, than you‚Äôll typically see on a commercial website. Think of a few large global organisations, check out their websites, and see what they do. I looked at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), [Dell](http://dell.com/) and [TimeWarner](http://www.timewarner.com/) ‚Äì they all have pretty similar text sizes, but the TimeWarner site is far less legible to my eyes. Checking the styles, it uses #333 for text.

Now of course, this isn‚Äôt meant to be conclusive proof of, well, anything really, but as long as your text remains below a certain size (let‚Äôs say 0.75em with 1em line spacing for an arbitrary line in the sand) you‚Äôll most likely be better off with black text rather than something ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù like #333 or #666.

Actually, Didier has followed up his previous post with [Contrasting Vision](http://superfluousbanter.org/archives/000194.php) which offers his readers the chance to select the most readable copy text and constant background colour and let him know. Of course, it took me quite a while to get there, because his #4C4C4C text makes my eyes blur. üòâ
