I’ve put it in [my del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/pip) but until [the inbox](http://del.icio.us/inbox/pip) is working again, no-one will see it – Codemasters have released [an official version of Treasure Island Dizzy for the PC](http://www.codemasters.co.uk/downloads/index.php?downloadid=17409)!

It’s a C64 emulator with the game built in rather than a port, and retains the original graphics, keyboard controls and allows you to save your game! Awesome!
