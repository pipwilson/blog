Microsoft launched [Spaces](http://spaces.msn.com/) today.

Dear God it’s shit. I don’t really have much more to say on the matter, so I’ll just quote one of my workmates who also signed up to see what it was like: <q>diabolical</q>.

I realise that this post will make you go to spaces to sign up and see what it’s like – really, don’t. You’ll just be wasting your life.

Oh, and although it’s functionally better in IE than in Firefox (drog and drop parts of a page Sharepoint-stylee and the post creator/editor actually works), the visual style keeps breaking badly in IE, whereas at least in Firefox all of the page actually appears each time you view it.

The MSN Messenger integration looks like it might be nice, but they’ve not released it yet and I don’t use Messenger anyway. Ho hum.
