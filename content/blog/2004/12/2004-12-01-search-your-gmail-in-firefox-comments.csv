It’s “Gmail” and not “gmail”, Phil.

Anyway, thanks for this neat browser extension. You’re right, this must save me literally seconds every day.  
One suggestion though: it would be nice if, when you don’t type anything and just hit enter, it takes you to <http://gmail.google.com/gmail/> instead of <http://gmail.google.com/> as that last URI redirects to the first one, which takes about a second or two.

Thanks again, and a happy new year!

Yes, you’re right about the URL. I should change that.

Thanks for your words, and a Happy New Year to you too!"

Lovely concept. As of Sept 9 2007 it’s still opening the gmail inbox without a search, and ignoring any open tabs (firefox 2.0).

Any chance your real life will let you get back to it for us receivers?

Thanks for sharing."
