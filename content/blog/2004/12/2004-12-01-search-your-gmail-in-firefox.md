Iâ€™ve only recently made the move from Firefox 0.9.x to 1.0 (I was waiting for all the extensions I use to finally get updated) and although I mainly do my searching using [keywords](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/smart-keywords.html "apparently they're called 'smart keywords' now"), Iâ€™m really enjoying the [search toolbar](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/search.html). Itâ€™s incredibly intuitive, and although Iâ€™m both **very** used to, and very quick at using keywords to perform all my searches I find myself using the search toolbar time and time again, itâ€™s clearly a very intuitive widget, and [massively extensible](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/) to boot.

Itâ€™s not actually listed on the [mycroft website](http://mycroft.mozdev.org/), but as well as Amazon, Wikipedia, IMDB and all the other search engines that can be plugged into it, thereâ€™s also one for [letting you search your gmail](http://www.tong-web.com/gmail/) (the â€˜installâ€™ link on the site doesnâ€™t work though, but you can [click this link to install the gmail search engine](javascript:addEngine('Gmail','png','web'))).

Itâ€™s actually quite useful being able to search your mail from your browser, especially when it lets you perform [complex queries like I wrote about before](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/11/gmail-searching.html).

![What using the gmail search toolbar looks like](/images/gmailsearch.png "Typing 'from:name' retrieves all the emails from that person")

Whatâ€™s also nice is that if you donâ€™t type anything and just hit enter it takes you straight to your inbox. Must save me literally *seconds* every day ðŸ™‚
