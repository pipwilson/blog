I finally got around to spending ten minutes to create a new design for this site that I might not hate quite as much as the last one. The HTML is slightly better, the CSS is just as bad, and links are painfully non-obvious, which Iâ€™ll need to fix. An added bonus is that Iâ€™ve broken all the links in my sidebar â€“ hooray for progress!

<ins datetime="2004-12-14T13:07:58Z"></ins>

And Iâ€™ve just noticed my layout breaks in 800Ã—600! Woo! I rock **so** hard ðŸ™‚
