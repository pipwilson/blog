I certainly won’t be sending it out again… I’ve got thoughts on better ways to get foafnaut working well again though.

I’ve unzipped it, run the script in question on it to convert to n3, and rebzipped it. The n3 file is 643 Meg, and the bzipped file is 34 meg.

It’s at <http://www.kid666.com/crschmidt/foaf.20040303.n3.bz2> .

Keep in mind that many tools can’t really deal with this all as one file – Redland had problems with this until the most recent release of Raptor, I believe – so you may not find it easy to dump stuff out into something usable. Also, working with huge stores is often not that quick – I’m surprised that FoafSpace is still keeping up so well.

I’m also happy to see people getting data out of other LJ-based sites: 6 of the top 20 are LJ-based. Whee for LJ 🙂"

Christopher, I think you pointed me at your more recent dump a month or so ago? Anyway, if it was on the web, then I’ve got it and have also run the script on this data. I’ve performed a little splitting on it and Jena seems to be coping, but I’ve yet to ask it anything really hard. 🙂"

As for releasing the data dump, there is currently no support for dumping the data back out in a form that would be easy to deal with as RDF, but I might add something like that in the future."
