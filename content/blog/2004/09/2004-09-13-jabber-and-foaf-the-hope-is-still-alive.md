stpeter has made three very interesting posts ([Disco RDF](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2004-09.html#2004-09-12T21:44), [Knowing](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2004-09.html#2004-09-12T21:05) and [Making Friends](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2004-09.html#2004-09-12T19:56)) which talk about the possibilities that would start to open up if Jabber clients (or more likely servers) started using FOAF <q cite="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2004-09.html#2004-09-12T19:56">to help Jabber users find people, chatrooms, and other entities of interest on the Jabber network</q>. It makes for interesting reading, and it would be good to see what direction the Jabber guys take this – adoption by an organisation like theirs could be what it takes to getting the FOAF guys to actually mark some more of those elements ‘stable’ and hence increase people’s trust in its stability.
