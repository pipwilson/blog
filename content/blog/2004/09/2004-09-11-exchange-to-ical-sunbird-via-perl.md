> I’ve got something I call vcalxical.pl, which is a perl script that logs into an Exchanged server running IMAP, and then reads a mailbox that is really a calendar, and pulls out the VCALENDAR parts, and formats them into an ics-type file.

Oh. My. God! And it just so small and simple, unbelievable!

Oh, how badly do I want this? Very badly. But I don’t even know if our Exchange server has IMAP enabled! First thing Monday morning. First. Thing.
