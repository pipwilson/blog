<q cite="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/005650.html">[According to Stephen Horlander](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=565298#565298), the new default theme for Firefox is ‘a 0.1 release at best’</q> (via [djst’s nest](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/005650.html))

It’s also well worth reading [djst’s previous post](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/005647.html) on the subject, where he goes into more detail about how the Winstripe theme doesn’t work on Windows XP. There are also a good selection of comments on that post, mainly about how when Qute was made the default, lots of people complained about it making Firefox look too much like a Windows app. Frankly, in my mind this is the audience Firefox should be after, and making it look like either less of one, or one with a lame skin is just asking for trouble.
