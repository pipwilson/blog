Let’s face it, what is good about HTML? It’s just a broken, sloppy, hard-to-parse, format that seems to have been invented by someone told about SGML via a \*long\* series of Chinese whispers."

[This diagram](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.littlespringsdesign.com%2Fdesign%2Fxhtmlinfo.html) sums up my current understanding of what the XHTML-MP really is, but my question is “why is it based on xhtml?”. What benefits has XHTML provided that makes it easier to provide XHTML-MP rather than HTML-MP (this is the main query), and why do mobile devices not just support full HTML or XHTML (I suspect there’s a good answer to that)? The problem I have with XHTML-MP is, that like most v4 browsers, they’re going to try and parse and display invalid markup, despite what the XML spec says on the subject, and so they may as well use existing parsing if not rendering engines. In addition, XHTML-Basic is a mess. Or at least it was last time I looked at it. My experience was similar to that of [Mark Pilgrim’s](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fdiveintomark.org%2Farchives%2F2003%2F03%2F15%2Fabout_the_mobile_edition) where he said “As I said, XHTML Basic has no basis in reality. Ignore it.”"
