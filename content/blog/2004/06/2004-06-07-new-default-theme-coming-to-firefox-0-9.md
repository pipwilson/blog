[New Default Theme Coming to Firefox 0.9 (Acts of Volition)](http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/june/newdefaulttheme).

And guess what? I don’t like it. I like Qute. I’d never seen Qute before it became the default theme in Firefox, but as soon as I saw it, I loved it – the navigation icons are very similar to IE, but better (in my opinion). The ones in Winstripe don’t do this, they’re simpler, but this reflects poorly, making Firefox look basic and just like so many other open source applications as if thought hasn’t been put in to the graphics. User’s don’t appreciate shadows. They don’t appreciate gradient fills. They appreciate things which look like the things they’re used to, but nicer.
