You only have to take a look through the closed bugs in Bugzilla to see that there were some quite major problems in printing for a good long while."

Set that value to false (double click on it) and you should be able to load from file:// urls."

i have a similar problem.  
its to do with php and javascript.  
Security Error: Content at [http://localhost/PROJ\_PHP/jobsandassets/index.php](http://localhost/PROJ_PHP/jobsandassets/index.php) may not load or link to file:///C|/Program%20Files/Apache%20Group/Apache2/htdocs/PROJ\_PHP/jobsandassets/templates/res/menu1.js.

&lt;script src=”file:///C|/Program%20Files/Apache%20Group/Apache2/htdocs/PROJ\_PHP/jobsandassets/templates/res/menu1.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

you should be using the HTTP URI instead:

&lt;script src=”http://localhost/PROJ\_PHP/jobsandassets/templates/res/menu1.js” type=”text/javascript”&gt;&lt;/script&gt;"
