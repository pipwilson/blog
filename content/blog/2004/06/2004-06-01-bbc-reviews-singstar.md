[Singstar](http://www.singstargame.com/en_GB/home.html), the home mass audience PS2 game by Sony this the shops a few weeks ago (it’s basically Karaoke for your PS2 but a bit cleverer – it’s ace fun, at any rate), and just got [a review on the BBC news website](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3746887.stm), except that that’s exactly what it reads like – one bloke’s quick, incomplete and superficial review, not that of a professional media organisation. The BBC has a place for this kind of review, the [Collective games section](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/C974).
