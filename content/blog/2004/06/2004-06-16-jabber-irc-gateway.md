About six months ago I spent some time poking around the Internet for an IRC library which could be used over Jabber (maybe providing either a chatroom or a gateway component, whatever), but drew a blank. I looked at [Martyr](http://martyr.sourceforge.net/ "A Java IRC Library") briefly to see if I could write one myself, but in all honesty it sounded like too much hard work for something I wouldn’t really use (I’m very rarely on IRC).

It seems like one of those things you’d have expected to have been around for ages, but as with much of the state of the Jabber world (a post on which I’m saving up), it’s just not there. So hurrah! for [yesterdays’ issue of the Jabber Journal](http://www.jabber.org/journal/2004-06-15.php) which mentions three such projects:

> There are now three IRC gateway projects underway: [one](http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/irc/) built on top of the Xmpppy library (running at irc.jabber.org.uk), [another](http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/jjigw/project/view.php) created by Jacek Konieczny (running at irc.projecto-oasis.cx, a fine free server in Portugal hosted by [3GNTW](http://www.3gnt.net/)), and a third that is native to the [ejabberd](http://ejabberd.jabberstudio.org/) server (running at irc.jabber.ru). Another option is [JIG](http://jig.jabberstudio.org/), a server-side component that enables any IRC client to be a Jabber client.

Typical, eh? You wait for one IRC gateway projects, and three turn up at once.
