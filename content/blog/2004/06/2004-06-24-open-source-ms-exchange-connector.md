Iâ€™m about a month behind the times, but on May 14th 2004 the [Novell Connector](http://www.novell.com/products/connector/) (which used to be called Evolution Connector) became open source instead of payware. This opens up the field for a whole host of Linux mail, PIM and groupware applications to start supporting MS Exchange servers (apps like [Kroupware](http://kroupware.org/), [Kontact](http://kontact.org/), and loads of Gnome stuff which I donâ€™t know the names of).

As far as desktop and office use of Linux this is a real breakthrough, at my last job I had a dual-booting Linux/Win2000 box, but I could only do productive work under Win2000 because Iâ€™d never get mails, calendar notifications, access to the company address book and so on.

For me, the applications are already good enough (reading/writing documents, coding, reading/writing mail, browsing the web and IM sums up about 95% of my computer use and I can do all of these things very happily on a Linux box) but now the ability to run Linux in the workplace where Outlook is king and remain connected is just incredible. Roll on the Linux office. ðŸ™‚
