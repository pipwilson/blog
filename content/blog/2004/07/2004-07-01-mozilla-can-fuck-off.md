My girlfriend and I were talking about computers the other day; she’s got one, but she’s just a normal user, and to be honest I was slightly surprised with the conversation we were having. “If anyone tried to tell me that I really should be using Linux and Firefox, I’d tell them to fuck off.” she said. Well, that’s her opinion made pretty clear. Despite my success with converting quite a few (maybe twenty?) people over to Firefox from IE, I’ve got absolutely no chance of converting my own girlfriend. What makes it worse is that we’re using Windows XP at home, and the default browser is a system setting, not a user setting, so whenever I’m on her machine and try to follow a link in my aggregator or mail client, up comes IE. Nightmare.

So anyway, that’s why it’s interesting to read [articles like this one in Slate:](http://slate.msn.com/id/2103152/ "How Mozilla's Firefox trumps Internet Explorer")

> You’ve probably been told to dump Internet Explorer for a Mozilla browser before, by the same propeller-head geek who wants you to delete Windows from your hard drive and install Linux. You’ve ignored him, and good for you.

I was kind of hoping that that article, along with [one from the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3840101.stm "Web browser flaw prompts warning") would help influence her, but instead she just said “That article seems to be saying ‘Use Firefox!!!’ ‘\*cough\* even though it means even this site won’t work properly’”, and she’s got a fair point. How do you convince users who couldn’t give two hoots about security or extra features to move? Ah, if only I could uninstall IE…
