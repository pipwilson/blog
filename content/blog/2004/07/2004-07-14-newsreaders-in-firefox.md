[Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/) is an aggregator extension for Firefox. It’s the spiritual successor to [the original RSS Reader Panel](http://fls.moo.jp/moz/rssreader.html). It’s also very good.

[Tim Bray picked up on it today](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/14/FirefoxReader). He says, variously that it’s <q>nice and simple</q>, <q>would hit a sweet spot for a lot of people</q>, oh, and <q>seems to handle all the different syndication formats just fine</q>.

As [I pointed out over on Gareth blog](http://xurble.org/blog/article/13/#comment), you can do cross-browser and location feed-synchronisation by using the [bookmark synchronisation extension](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=41742), and take the effort out of sorting the feeds by using the [sort bookmarks extension](http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/sortbookmarks).

[Phil Ringnalda](http://philringnalda.com/) doesn’t like it (see comment 6 on the link aove) but to be honest, I think that provided you can install extensions in the browser you’re using then for simple aggregation it’s miles better than Bloglines (disclaimer: I’ve not checked it out since they revamped earlier this week) which never seems to actually return unread items when I ask for them, and despite the almost universal praise, I’ve found to be pretty unsatisfactory.
