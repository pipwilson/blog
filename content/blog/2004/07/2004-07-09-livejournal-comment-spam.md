I woke up this morning thinking about [Livejournal ](http://www.livejournal.com/)comment spam. I mean, do they get any? How do they prevent it? Do thet use an [mt-blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/) equivalent? Of course a lot of the problem is mitigated by the fact that lj is effectively one big trust network and you can disable people who aren’t already on your list of friends from leaving coments. But this isn’t the default behaviour. By default anonymous comments can be left, so, what do they do to prevent abuse?

It turns out most of the answers are on the [LiveJournal Spam: Overview / FAQ](http://www.livejournal.com/community/lj_biz/219332.html) page, and I could quote it extensively, but you may as well just go and read for yourself – it basically says “we can change anything whenever we want because we’re a closed system and we also have some extra systems in place”. Certainly of the few people I know who have livejournal accounts I’ve never seen any evidence of comment spam so obviously the measures they’ve got in place seem to work.
