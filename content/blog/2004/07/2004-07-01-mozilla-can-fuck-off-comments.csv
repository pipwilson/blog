There’s probably a dll that only IE depends on that would stop IE from working, nuking just that would be a simple way of hamstringing IE 🙂"

Fuck Firefox and every Firefox fanboi\* that thinks having firefox make them “different”.

You all claim Firefox is faster, more secure, but these two notions are IMPOSSIBLE. Your connection speed NOT your browser determines your surfing speed. And the only security difference is that Internet Explorer can handle ActiveX, but it asks you if you want to install them anyway.

Now I’m probably going to get a bunch of Firefox fanboys whining about how they “got 218371938 viruses” when they used IE, but I have one other complaint.

LUNUX IS NOT BETTER THAN WINDOWS. You can’t compare the two. Granted, they are both operating systems, but they’re both for different things, I’ll play games on Windows, and surf the internet on my IE with tabbed browsing. You can whack off to the mozilla firefox homepage and Linux logo. I don’t care.

Some options on firefox are reliable such as saving your personal passwords and settings (single users) which on IE you can’t. on firefox you can easly get pictures that is unable on IE when you use right click on your mouse. on firefox you can browse the web with mutiple tabs in one window, unlike IE where you have on open more windows draining your RAM. you can also have more opion on your favorite for quicker access on firefox.

so far firefox has lot of advantage over IE. firefox even have pop up, virus and spyware protector. basicly IE is no match for firefox, but there is one thing that IE have that firefox doesn’t. some website requires IE such as Internet Explore Windoes: Update (<http://update.microsoft.com/windows>  
update).  
*why is it important?*  
Without IE you can’t update your computer anymore, can’t detect new software for your computer needs, trying to uninstall IE would be a big mistake on your part. eventually you’ll have to reinstall IE just so you can update your PC (if you need   
<http://update.microsoft.com>). Another advantage that IE have is that some Audio player (webs player) also requires IE to play video, or simply just an audio file. (hmm….) like Yahoo music (unless firefox cover that problem up).

overall I think firefox is a great browser tool to add on your computer, as for IE just leave it on your PC because like i said before, some website requires IE. and for Linux … I have no comment on it (haven’t used or think of using it)"

1\. You can save personal passwords and settings on both IE6 and IE7, what are you talking about?

2\. You can save images with a simple right click on IE6 and IE7, what are you talking about?

3\. Actually tabbed browsing takes way more RAM than window browsing, but IE7 does allow for Tabbed browsing.

4\. More option on your favorite for quick access? What are you talking about? Favorites work the same way on Firefox and IE.

“Firefox even have pop up, virus and spyware protector.”

1\. I use IE7 (used to use IE6) and I havn’t gotten any form of malicious program on my computer in a year. If you’re having a problem with malicious code, get a better antivirus, like Nod32.

2\. IE7 does have a popup blocker, and if you’re running IE6 you could always get Google taskbar, which blocks popups the same way firefox blocker does.

57,2006-05-25T18:20:00+00:00,Anonymous,,,comment,0,"First of all a big thanks you and twelve thumbs up to everyone who’s posted recently with anti-bloody-firefox stuff. I too got here with “fuck firefox”, and I agree totally. Firefox sucks.

1.) Tabbed browsing, whoop-de-fucking-do. As someone has said, tabbed browsing can take MORE RAM than separate windows, and I’ve certainly never noticed any increase in speed with firefox. In fact, it is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER to both open and load pages. And I mean significantly.  
The other problem with tabbed browsing is closing stuff you didn’t want to. Okay, okay, I know firefox asks you first if you’ve got more than one tab, but even so, the risk is still far greater. Plus, opening different tabs is just harder and more irritating than separate windows.

2.) Downloading files. With IE it’s a simple right click, save image. With firefox it opens that bloody annoying download window thing, it’s like the web browser equivolent of the paperclip in word. I KNOW I just downloaded that image, I don’t want a separate window about it. I thought you were supposed to tab stuff anyway, not open more windows?!

3.) Anti-virus/spam/etc. Sorry, but I’ve NEVER found a single popup or bit of spam that I get with IE that I don’t get with firefox. If it does protect at all, it’s obviously not very good at it. The overriding fact is, if you have a decent firewall and anti-spyware software, as all internet capable computers should, then you don’t -need- anything in firefox.

4.) Some sites don’t work with Firefox. I should also note this is largely because of them just not being compatable, whereas firefox users actually deliberately and maliciously set up sites that don’t work with IE to try and force people to use firefox. If it was that great why force people, hmmm?

5.) So far I haven’t seen or been told of any features on firefox that you can’t get on IE, worthwhile ones anyway.

6.) The hype. EVERYONE is always bloody going on and on and on about firefox and I’m sick of it! Firefox itself isn’t any better that IE, but the thing that compounds it and makes it even worse is the way people keep saying how amazing it is."

In my past experiences, I have had to remove or intercept spyware/ad’s etc with the use of third party programs to avoid my internet explorer (and not to mention the whole system) getting bogged down in a wave of unauthorised crap.

Since my move to firefox, I still use these third party programs (CCleaner etc) but I find firefox to be alot more dependable after i download and view such lurid material.

The clearing of internet history, cache, temporary files etc are all tied to one lovely little button (if you want) which allows you to easily clear most evidence of your internet behaviour on your end. Whereas Internet Explorer has THREE buttons and a significant amount of lag if youve been surfing for longer periods…3 Buttons! Who do they think I am a gymnast?

Lastly, I have never ever had a problem in Firefox with:  
1 – Change/Hijacked homepage  
2 – Extra browser buttons being added without permission  
3 – Speed (always been faster than IE)"

Well here’s my 2 cents: I first moved to Firefox because of the hijacks/popups/un-wanted installs that use to happen to me. This was way before IE upgraded to include popup protection. It’s true that I need to use IE to view some sites, but apart from that i never had a problem with Firefox. Also i find it SO easy to use tabs in Firefox – just click my middle button (the scroll wheel) on a link to open it in a new tab, and click the same button on a tab to close it! How easy is that? Well, apart from the in-built ‘Google search bar'(never been a fan of installing toolbars in IE), tabbed browsing is my favourite feature in Firefox. In regard to Linux… I have tried it and i believe it is a great operating system (if you know how to use it) but i’ve never spent the time to learn it, and i can’t be bothered to find alternate applications to the ones i currently use in windows (i know about Windows emulators but….and i like to play games made for Windows OS….) So where do i stand? (now that IE is kinda fixed?) I’ll sit on the fence for a bit longer and let you guys fight it out 😉 But it’s hard to change from what you’re use to….true?"

Maybe if IE followed a single standard you wouldn’t have to code “for IE” or “for Mozilla” and could just code to standards. IE’s the reason we can’t use CSS 2. IE doesn’t even support DOM 1 completely. What a POS."

If IE properly implemented CSS, you can bet your ass every other serious browser would. IE’s bad CSS is the reason you can’t use certain CSS constructs, which is the reason other browsers have no incentive to support them as they can’t be used anyway."

FF is a hassle. It’s a separate install, and as that speed test indicated, generally slower than IE, especially in startup. Spyware is not as prevalent as it used to be (I haven’t been hit in over a year, using generally unpatched IE6 with minimal security settings), so the security superiority of FF is negligible.

And there are still a decent number of webpages that don’t work properly with it. Why care if it’s technically the page’s fault for not adhering to web standards…the fact simply is, IE works with more pages as they were intended to be viewed than FF does. You’re not going to win over the mainstream of PC users who could care less by waging some silly stubborn crusade by continuing to use FF.

I honestly think some people use it as a form of ‘geek cred’, that they’re using as few ‘evil M$’ products as possible (since most of them probably are afraid to nuke Windows and attempt to use Linux).

And as far as the comment about INTERNET SPEED (sic) making your web browser fast – Mozilla Firefox is faster because of its updated rendering engines and page loading mechanics, thus making it faster than IE.

I just think it’s all in the same with firefox users, they are trying to give two fingers to gates et all at microsoft just because they are the monopoly. Well there is a reason they are the monopoly and it’s generally because their software is pretty good at it’s job and has created standards across the pc platform. It allows for multiple programs to work together as if they were a suite. Why try and stick two fingers to a company that keeps your computer cohesive and easy to run?

As for people saying firefox doesn’t display websites because their code is shit is also a load of bollocks. I programmed a tentative html 1.0 website, the oldest type possible, tested perfectly for errors which displayed fine in IE 6 / 7 and Opera 9 but fucked up in firefox. Now I’m not anal enough to find out why firefox thinks my website should be rammed into the far left corner, but it pissed me off.

However dispite this, I am in favour of firefox’s existence because mozilla have helped microsoft finally fix a few niggles since IE 5, especially within security and the tabbed browsing can be useful for just clicking to view a picture or something."

For all the people who are complaining about their websites not looking good in firefox, do the following:

a) learn CSS  
b) start building standard compliant websites.

There is a crashing issue which pisses me off about firefox. So i use explorer sometimes. No problem. Have both browsers each has its unique strenghts.

 I’m sure FireFux is a safer browser that IE, of that I have no doubt.

 But why? Because hackers don’t waste their time on browsers no-one uses.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The reason why hackers don’t mess with Firefox is because it isn’t a Microsoft product. Hackers hack Microsoft products like Internet Explorer and Windows to make a point, that they are vulnerable and insecure. It’s to make people realize this and hopefully they would switch from what’s considered to be the Evil Money-Hungry Monopolizong Empire known as Microsoft.

It had nothing to do with because it wasn’t used as much.  
Just like some people “hack” people’s wireless connections and “take them over” and *some* people “hack” other people’s websites follows the same reasoning why hackers originally started hacking Microsoft products – to prove a point – that it’s insecure and vulnerable.  
Another reason hackers always favored linux and firefox and targeted Microsoft products was Microsoft has a bad image and reputation with the open-source communities. It was to help drive them away from what was/is considered to be a “money-hungry, monopolizing, unsecure and vulnerable, evil empire”.

I agree with them all the way.

Microsoft has always been monopolizing. With browsers like Netscape they weren’t willing to compromise or agree, with Sun Java, etc.   
Even with Vista, the software and hardware companies had begun making drivers for the new OS and what did they do? At the last minute, completely changed the code and that’s one reason why there still isn’t that many drivers that are ready for Vista when it came out.   
Why’d they do it? Most likely because it got “hacked” and they wanted to try to throw the “hackers” off by writing up some new code.   
As if it was going to stop them…. IT’S TEXT, FFS!  
Microsoft completely screwed the customers who DO pay for the OS, because they didn’t have drivers for the new software they paid $400+ for. People paid $400+ and still continue to do so, for what? To be beta-testers for something Microsoft claim to be “releaseable”.  
It’s crap wrapped in pretty wrapping.  
They couldn’t give a damn about the people they need to be keeping happy – their paying customers.  
Now because they’re fighting some hackers that want to make MS Windows freely available to test before people get suckered into paying for some junk that even paying customers had bought and RETURNED and have actually turned some old Windows users into Linux users (me for one),  
continuing on… because they’re more concerned about their money and fighting the hackers, they’re making their paying customers suffer because:  
1\. Those customers have a new junk OS they paid for that has/had very few drivers for it. All the hardware and software that their paying customers paid for that was supposed to be “Vista Ready/Compatible” wasn’t/isn’t. But it was MS’s fault, not the hardware/software companies.  
2\. Paying customers have to go through hell to activate their products now.  
3\. When their paying customers had to reformat the junk OS’s too many times, they had to go through hell to get it reinstalled because the software wouldn’t let them! So they would have to call up customer support to get it reinstalled!   
If anyone remembers correctly, a lot of those people that had to, commented on how they were treated like criminals over the phone because they weren’t believed that they had actually paid for it! Customer service treated them as if they had “stolen” the software.  
Not to mention the “Is Your Copy of Windows Genuine?” button on the top of every directory of PAID FOR XP INSTALLATIONS!

And they sure as hell aren’t going to let you leave. They’re going to keep you relying on the only software they make available at installation… theirs.  
DirectX, .pst’s, Microsoft Media Player, Internet Explorer. I still haven’t been able to break completely away yet, because all my hardware me and my husband spent hundredsd of dollars on are all Windows-based! I still haven’t had a chance to convert my .pst files to be able to access my email because most programs, if I use it to convert them, I’ll lose a vital portion of my data!  
I can’t tell you how much money I’ve lost and how many hours have been wasted creating important documents that got wiped out by bluescreens!  
Thanks Microsoft!

Amen to the hackers!

I’d rather try the crap they’re pumping out to people, before spending that much money on it. Especially to have to go through the hell paying customers do, which I have been one of them. I even bought XP 3 times!  
But the average person cannot spend 400+ on an OS, plus buy all the software that makes a system worthwhile and to keep it clean, secure and bug-free.  
If it wasn’t for me, my mother would still be stuck with Windows 95!   
Does Microsoft care? Hell no.  
But the great open-source and Linux hackers do. They care enough to spend their free time and resources creating and updating great OS’s that are unbelievably secure and stable compared to Windows and that aren’t being attacked by hackers because those hackers aren’t going to attack “the cause” – which is an excellent one.

Many people are reluctant to switch when IE is all they’ve ever known. Some people just don’t want to install “extra” software when IE already comes packaged.  
I have never told someone else what browser they should use but god knows how many times I’ve had people bash products that have been nothing but good and extremely useful to me and they expect me not to say anything back about it?

The only thing that IE has going for it is it’s the only piece of software on the OS that’s “stable”, relativly speaking.  
Otherwise, truth is, it’s vulnerable and unsecure, as “hackers” have proven time and time again. The webpages ONLY come out right on IE and not any other browsers because they’re the only ones screwing up the specifications. They even admitted to having screwed up the specifications and people have known that there were all types of web coding issues with IE  
<http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx>  
You could make a page look great in all the browsers, but IE would be the only one with issues. You could make a page look great in IE, but it would look horrible in all the others. Many others can’t be wrong.  
There are also many great features in Firefox (and other browsers) that aren’t in IE, like tabbed browsing that IE has JUST implemented when they realized how many people found great use for it. Many things that IE has just considered doing because everyone else has done them and the new features have turned out to be a big hit! IE is just a follower browser.  
There are many reasons that make Firefox and other browsers superior to IE. Nobody is bashing “you”, we’re making valid points to the browser and no matter how hard you hate to admit it, you know the points made are true, most of them anyway, I have seen people exaggerate at times.  
I’ve had my own issues with Firefox. There was a time that it overwrote all my settings when it updated, there was a time that it would take 2 minutes+ to load a page (but reinstalling it sorted that. I had it installed for several months and installed quite a few extensions), I’ve had quite a few times when I had a few choice words for Firefox, but even so, compared to IE, no matter how upset I was with Firefox, I cannot stand here and deny the fact that it’s superior to IE. From the coing standards to the great features to the security of it, I can’t deny that.   
With any software that gets updated, you’re going to have issues time to time, but IE has a problem with letting their issues regardless of if the user sees it or not, they have a problem with letting the issue go on for ages before doing something about it.

Anyway, I’m quite happy with my system that is stable and dependable. I know that if I leave a file unsaved overnight, the next mnorning, it will  
still be there. No freezes, no bluescreens. I don’t need to spend any money to have something “decent” (my choice word – excellent). No spyware/adware, virus protection and firewall protection software needed. I don’t need to buy Microsoft Office just so I can have a decent text editor than notepad. The list goes on and on.  
Linux provides me with all the types of software and even games that you can get with Windows and so much more, with the same features and even more of them, and at what cost?   
Need support? I get that too, all free. There’s TONS of info on Linux all over Google and many other places. Go into the linux forums and there’s many great, friendly linux users willing to help you sort out any problem or question you might have.

Microsoft, with all that money they’ve been making – you think they would have kept up with and updated their browser to be something great but all that time it was the free browsers that were listening to their userbase and keeping up with the W3C web standards, guidelines and specifications and acting on it, always doing something about it and keeping it updated and something that their users wanted.   
To all the open-source developers and the users of those products that give them a reason to keep at it – I for one, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You all will always have my most sincere gratitude and support.

A poster claimed that the network connection plus system speed are the only pieces of the formula regarding speed; that is completely wrong. The rendering engine plus http method of the browser client has a tremendous impact on speed.

IE3 for instance loaded pages initially far quicker than Netscape did at the time (or Nutscrape as I like to call it). Same connection, same computer. Netscape, however, traversed faster than IE3 once it was up and running.

Firefox (generally) renders faster than IE does now simply due to less bloat – the tradeoff is manual installation of many plugins.

It is quite possible (probable?) that IE will be slimmed down in the future (or perhaps a faster browser product from Microsoft) will come about and the cycle will just rinse and repeat like any other technology."

I got this page by typing:  
“where the fuck is my old HOME PAGE??? If Firefox keeps doing this I’m gonna switch back!!!!!!!”  
into the generic Firefox/google homepage that Firefox insists in replacing my OWN homepage with whenever I update.  
Ordinarily this wouldn’t be such a problem but the last upgrade (which was a full Firefox download) actually deleted/lost all of my favorites and bookmarks.

Don’t get me wrong, I like Firefox and I hate IE but I still use IE for many things and I have never had a problem working on a system that had IE as the default browser.  
Is one better than the other? Who cares? The better question should be: Does it do what you need it to do? Both Firefox and IE work just fine.  
I don’t get any more virus’s from IE than I do in Firefox.. (zero in both, although my “Avast” virus software has caught a few things from time to time.  
Right now my IE is refusing to update due to some past update not installing correctly… (an issue which Windows seems to not give a shit about) so I don’t have the latest IE and I don’t really care. My firefox works fine.  
If only I could get it to quit changing my god damn home page!!!

xhtml standards and such, given firefox and \*cough\* opera, you have to take double the time to develop a web page just because after you make it work with IE – you have to spend some more time making it work with firefox, regardless of standards or not, IE being the most used browser, you want your site to be perfect with it. Another thing that firefox sucks with is its javascript, standards or not, ie’s DOM has more methods that are actually useful whereas with firefox you have to scan the whole DOM tree to get an element’s relative position to its parent.

As for Linux vs. Windows – nothing to argue about there, anyone who does is an idiot: You use windoze to play / work, and you use Linux TO RUN FUCKING WEBSERVERS AND SUCH (web, database, dns, routing etc). you do not run services on windows (be it 2003 server) because that sucks."

All I want to say is that I hate Firefox with all my heart and I really don’t get those who like it (specially those who like it over IE7) and try to convince others to use it too.

I’m a website developer and just because of firefox I have to spend twice as much time on making a website work with firefox than it would take to make the whole fucking site.

Someone before me posted about standards and poor programming. I agree, programmers should follow standards, but the thing is that even if you follow standards or not with Internet Explorer the result is the same while firefox fucks it all up.

I’m sick and tired of it and from some time now i don’t even give a rats ass on how would it look with firefox. I simply ignore it.

From the website developers point of view firefox is a nightmare and i don’t see how could that be any different from any other point of view.

I could go on with the pro’s and con’s but i really don’t feel the need to. My websites logs say it all!!

70% of the users\* use IE and only 26% use FireFox  
The remaining 4% are mostly Opera users or other linux based browsers.

So, if you’re not sure what to use or which it better just ask yourself “why only 26% of users\* uses FireFox?”
