> SpellBound is a port of the spell checker user interface from Mozilla’s Composer that enables spell checking in web forms (e.g. html textarea and html input elements – html input password elements are not checked by SpellBound). This allows you to spell check forms (e.g. a comment on a message board, etc.) before submitting them.

And it’s excellent. I was really expecting something that looked like the Firefox and IE current “find” dialog and I was pretty surprised to instead see this:

Of course, this is absolutely perfect for things like blog comments and wikis where you want to make sure that you get your spelling just right without having to copy’n’paste into a different app.

The download page has [a huge list of different languages and dictionaries](http://www.exchangecode.com/spellbound/#installation) that SpellBound can support, including, **hurrah!**, UK English! “color” begone! Out, out damn “recognize”!
