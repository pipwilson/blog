The slides and source code for [Russell Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/)‘s J2ME presentation at ETech [are available for download](http://www.russellbeattie.com/projects.zip).

The code includes Hello World, a Google searcher, RSS reader and Amazon searcher. Nice stuff and an excellent resource for people looking to get started in mobile development.

Also nice to see a slide with “Don’t trust the emulator!” on it. 🙂
