I missed this earlier this week but thereâ€™s an [online Atom to RSS 1.0 converter](http://cavedoni.com/2004/02/rss1) which uses a plain XSLT to do the conversion.

The resultant feeds pass the [feed validator](http://feedvalidator.org/) test and **almost** passes the [RDF validator](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/) except for some deprecated elements, but pretty good going!
