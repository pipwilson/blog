Sometime recently [Ananova](http://www.ananova.com/) stopped providing TV listings. “Oh no”, you might think, “what a tragedy”. Yet it is. Ananova was the only online source I knew of which produced (free) TV listings in [XMLTV](http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/) as well as the more usual HTML format.

[This piece by Matt Biddulph](http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000038.html) from the end of last year details some of the work you can do to generate listings in RDF (from where of course, you could do things like create events in your RDF calendar).

So for now it looks like the only real alternative is to use [the xmltv project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltv/) to pull down xmltv sources and then pass them through to your app. It’s a shame though because the Ananova feeds gave some programme description as well as just the basic time, channel and title which the xmltv app gives you.
