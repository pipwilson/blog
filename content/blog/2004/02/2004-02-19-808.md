Blimey, talk about early adoption – I was reading this [article about mod\_python on ONLamp](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/10/02/mod_python.html) when I suddenly noticed that they have an Atom feed as well as an RSS feed! Not only that, but the article supports trackback!

This was one of my (**very**) few visits to ONLamp, so apologies if this is news old enough to eat your chips off, but we’re really seeing a lot of early Atom adoption – I genuinely thought it would take much longer than this, and I suppose that once Disney start publishing Atom feeds (or were those only for internal consumption? I forget and can’t find the link I want – [this piece on Ross Mayfield’s Weblog](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/disney_enterpri.html) will have to do. What a dashing chap) a few of the other big players (like the BBC) might notice.
