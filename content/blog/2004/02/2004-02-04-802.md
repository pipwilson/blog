It seems that [Johnny Rotten’s little outburst](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3457199.stm) on “I’m desperate, make me a celebrity” drew 88 complaints from members of the public. I don’t get it – first of all it’s JOHNNY ROTTEN former singer of the Sex Pistols, punk icon and man generally famous for swearing, and then it’s AFTER THE WATERSHED and there’s even a WARNING before show about possible naughty language. Do people really have nothing better to do?

(oh, and he said “fucking cunts” \*looks around naughtily\*)
