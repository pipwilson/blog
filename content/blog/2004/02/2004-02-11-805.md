Oooooh, bad Blogger!

I’ve just checked what [my atom feed](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/atom.xml) looks like, and Blogger’s funking the titles. What’s “Until recently I which almost always sells them mo…” supposed to be then? It’s a [valid feed](http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpipthepixie.tripod.com%2Fatom.xml) but that doesn’t really help me (or readers) much when the titles are clearly nonsense.

It seems to be a character issue (possibly something to do with encoding? I apologise if this is the stupidest thing to say ever :)). Everything between the first and last non-alphanumeric character is skipped, leaving a title made up of two, possibly complete disparate sentences.

For example [this post from Wednesday](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2004_02_01_blog.html#107592664077803499) starts \[Until recently I’\] (at which point it cuts off) and the text immediately after the last non-alphanumeric character is \[” which almost always sells them mo\]. Tada, we have our mangled headline.

Discovering exactly which characters choke the Atom generaction is left as an exercise for the reader. 🙂
