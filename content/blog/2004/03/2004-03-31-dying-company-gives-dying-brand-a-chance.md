> AOL: New Mozilla-based Netscape 7.x coming shocker

AOL are going to be releasing a new version of the Netscape 7 browser based on a recent Mozilla milestone. This is really awesome. Despite AOLâ€™s financial, uh, downturn millions of people use it around the world, and know it as a brand (let alone as a coaster manufacturer).

Hopefully bundling the latest Mozilla code will serve to raise peopleâ€™s expectations of what a browser should be able to do, and then, when they move on from AOL replace their flaky IE with the browser theyâ€™re used to. From tiny acorns. ðŸ™‚
