I just stumbled across [htmldog.com â€“ A Good Practice Guide to XHTML and CSS](http://www.htmldog.com/) which covers a lot of ground and breaks up its tutorials into sections (beginner, intermediate and advanced) and has other good articles such as [Bad Tags](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/htmlintermediate/badtags/) for those which give problems or are best avoided altogether.
