[DowningStreetSays](http://www.downingstreetsays.com/) ([via 2lmc](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/4038)) and [Public Whip](http://www.publicwhip.org.uk)

the latter of which is a very decent roundup of [Hansard](http://www.parliament.uk/hansard/hansard.cfm) voting. I used to get the info from the [Grauniadâ€™s Aristotle](http://politics.guardian.co.uk/aristotle/) but this is much more interesting. ðŸ™‚

This all cropped up yesterday, but I was too lazy to blog it then. ðŸ˜‰
