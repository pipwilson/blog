Almost a year old now, but the PyCon [Introduction to the Semantic Web and RDF](http://www.amk.ca/talks/semweb-intro/) is still very good, and most usefully provides sample Python code.

In the same vein, [Building Metadata Applications with RDF](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/02/12/rdflib.html) very ably demonstrates how to handle RDF documents in Python and is an excellent primer in getting started with Rdflib (both of these articles use [RDFlib](http://rdflib.net/)).
