It seems like forever since I posted about CSS and web development in general, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll pick up again when I move onto rewriting our corporate site. ðŸ™‚

In the meantime, there are a couple of things I picked out of [Dunstanâ€™s blogmarks](http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/blogmarks/) that I think are worth pointing out:

[A really nice technique for highlighting the form element which has current focus by ryan brill](http://www.ryanbrill.com/archives/experimenting_with_highlighting) which [he later revists](http://www.ryanbrill.com/archives/form_highlighting_redux/ "with code examples").

Also, [a big list of screencaps of blogs with ace design](http://www.marcapaginas.net/postearte/galeria.php?page=3)
