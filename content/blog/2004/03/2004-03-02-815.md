Even 2lmc are spooling Ed talking about [Making GNOME hot for content creation](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/03/01-content/read) so in the name of all that’s fair, I’d like to plug [KimDaba](http://ktown.kde.org/kimdaba/) (again), which a decent image database manager thing with good categorisation and allows you to specify who each picture depicts and also to annotate certain areas of it, but which could do with being able to generate RDF to describe the pictures (as well as the related FOAF).

And no, I still don’t support trackback.
