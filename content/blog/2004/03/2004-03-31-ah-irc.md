Apparently it’s all the rage on the interweb but I’ve never really used IRC all that much, and since Firefox is my main browser I haven’t got easy access to ChatZilla, or so I thought. Of course, it’s [available as an extension](http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/chatzilla) and works just great with Firefox 0.8 and is even executable from the command line with a quick

```
firefox -chrome chrome://chatzilla/content/
```

Finally I can keep up with what’s going on over in [\#foaf](irc://irc.freenode.net/#foaf)!
