Of interest to people who want to check the latest TV guide on their PDAs (i.e. me) are:

- [Radio Times on your PDA](http://radiotimes.tvcompass.com/rt/Home.aspx) (via [The Daily Chump](http://pants.heddley.com/2004/03/02/2004-03-02.html#1078223226.435319)) which costs money
- [TellyGuide](http://www.fourteenminutes.com/code/tellyguide/) which can utilise AvantGo and Plucker, so they get points for good use of existing applications as well as for being free
- [Zookware](http://www.zookware.com/) which is also free but Palm OS only (which is fine by my Clié) and has too few screenshots for my liking.

I’ve not actually used any of these and they may all suck, but you don’t want me to spoil the surprise for you do you?
