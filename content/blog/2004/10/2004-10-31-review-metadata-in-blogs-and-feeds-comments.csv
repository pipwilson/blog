I know that Alf wrote [an RVW plugin for MT](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pmbrowser.info%2Fwiki.pl%3FRVW_Movable_Type_Plugin) but I don’t *think* it’s widely used. What’s really needed is for one of the tools above to take hold of this by the scruff of the neck and enable the RVW module in feeds – it’s not as if it would make anything incompatible – this is what namespaces are for!."
