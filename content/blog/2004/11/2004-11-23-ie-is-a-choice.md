Gary Schare, Microsoft’s director of product management for Windows says:

Well, excuse me, but I used IE for years and never had a say in the matter. I turned on my computer for the first time years ago, and IE was just there. That was it. There were no “factors”; nothing influenced me one way or another. No-one had to convince me to use one browser over another, because as far as I was concerned, *there weren’t any other browsers*.

Now I know there’s a choice, [IE isn’t the one I choose](http://getfirefox.com).
