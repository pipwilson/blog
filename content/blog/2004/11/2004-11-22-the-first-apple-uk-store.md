Apple opened their first shop in the UK [on Regent Street](http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/regentstreet/) at the weekend, and unbeknownst to me, my little brother was there.

In fact not only was he there, but he actually went to join the queue late on Friday night (I should point out that he doesnâ€™t actually live in London) and was one of the first 100 or so customers (heâ€™s spent a lot of time sleeping since then so Iâ€™ve not had much chance to keep up with him) to get into the store. Apparently the queue was quite a friendly group, and he spent the night chatting away to other Mac-loving nerds who had also decided to spend the night.

Not only **that** but he got a [Lucky Bag](http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/lucky_bags.html) (I had to find out later that it cost him Â£250!!!), although no iPod (they were only 1 per 6 bags, apparently theyâ€™re normally 1 per 3 bags in the US?) heâ€™s very pleased with the contents, although heâ€™ll probably sell the wireless keyboard and mouse as he already has a [iMac G5](http://www.apple.com/imac/).

Iâ€™m still scouring [Applestore pics on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/applestore/) and [macitynet](http://www.macitynet.it/immagini/visitaconnoi/expolondra04/applestorelondra3/index.shtml) to try and find an inadvertant picture of his eager little face ðŸ™‚

(also check out what [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2004/11/apple_store_opening/index.php) and [Rich Rutter](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1318/) have to say on the matter)
