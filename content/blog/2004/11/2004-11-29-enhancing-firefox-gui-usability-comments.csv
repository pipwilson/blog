But still, for those rare occasions when it’s necessary, I want that back button to be as easy to hit as it can be 🙂"

I use the Back button very often and this should help a great deal (I also have my preferences set to “use small icons, small, no text”).

185,2004-12-05T00:25:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Hi anon, putting /\* … \*/ around the CSS will stop it working.

There’s possibly a combination of settings which stops the CSS from working as-is (this is just a guess), in which case you could try using:

\#back-button .toolbarbutton-icon {  
padding-left: 10px !important;  
padding-right: 10px !important;  
}

instead. If that still doesn’t work, leave another comment with you contact details (or use my [contact form](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fphilwilson.org%2Fcontact%2F)) and I’ll see if I can help."

These versions of IE have replaced the entire toolbar with a huge BACK button, as can be seen in screenshots here: [Longhorn IE](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.winsupersite.com%2Fimages%2Fshowcase%2Flonghorn_4051_101.jpg). In any case, you are correct about the current version of IE, but Longhorn emphasizes this quite a bit more."

189,2004-12-05T16:21:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Ah, thanks for that nate. The image Ben Roe linked to in his article when referring to Longhorn was the standard IE6 ‘selective text on right’, but this is clearly quite different!

Also, many thanks to the Anonymous poster above with the intimate knowledge of the custom Mozilla properties, I’ll update the post to reflect this new info! Obviously I should have spent longer in the DOM Inspector!"

Maybe you can set direction:rtl on the button? I’ll have a play later."

194,2004-12-12T06:47:00+00:00,Anonymous,,,comment,0,"Well, I’ve figured out how to get the labels on for all the buttons. Took a bit of config, but it works.

The line: -moz-box-orient: horizontal !important; needs to be placed under the buttons section in the browser.css file within the classic.jar archive.

The cell padding etc can still be modified via userChrome.css

Hope this helps others.

Cheers,

Still good that you’re highlighting how easily you can customise Firefox though."

anybody here knows if it’s possible to make firefox look like this?

[here](http://ficod.deviantart.com/art/Firefox-GUI-mockup-62358031)

Basically what is needed is to “extend” the “bar” look behind the tabbar and make the “go” button as big as the stop one: is it possible to do it with a theme?

cheerz,
