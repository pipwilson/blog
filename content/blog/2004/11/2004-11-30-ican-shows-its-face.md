A new story on the BBC news website about how [we should use second class post instead of first class](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4052741.stm " Use second class, says Postwatch") passes the time, but of real interest is the link in the top-right to [the BBC iCan page about Post Offices](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ican/C2412 "This page aims to bring together helpful information on Post offices. ").

iCan has been alive (but in beta) for something like two years now, and I‚Äôve never before seen mention of it on the main BBC site (although in a recent iCan survey I did say ‚Äúneeds more publicity‚Äù üôÇ ‚Äì does this mean it‚Äôs about to leave beta? Will it actually launch?

iCan is a great site and resource, but it doesnn‚Äôt seem to have had the same design care and attention that [the main BBC site](http://www.bbc.co.uk) and [the BBC Collective](http://www.bbc.co.uk/collective/) have had. A bit more love in the looks department and I think it‚Äôs ready to hit prime-time.
