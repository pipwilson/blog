James Bunton has completely rewritten [the MSN transport for Jabber](http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/) in [Python](http://python.org/) using the [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) framework which has built-in support for [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org).

This looks to not only clear up long-standing bugs and memory leaks with [the original msn-t](http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/old/index.html) but also comes with far better [installation instructions](http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/docs/server.html) <del>(in wiki format no less so you can edit them yourself)</del> which go all the from installing Python and Twisted on Windows, Mandrake and Debian to writing the configuration files youâ€™ll need.

I have two MSN accounts and so use two MSN transports (msn.here.dk and msn.jabber.zim.net.au) and at only one of them tends to be up at a time so Iâ€™ll be looking at running two PyMSNt instances on my jabber server (jabbernet.org) so I can reduce the reliance on external services (also it means itâ€™ll be in my own best interest to keep them running). With the new useful instructions it should be any easy job. Iâ€™ll let you know. ðŸ™‚
