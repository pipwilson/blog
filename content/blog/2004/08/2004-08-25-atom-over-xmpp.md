Finally! Now that [Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/)‚Äòs [sent it to the atom-syntax mailing list](http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg08825.html) and [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/)‚Äòs [b-linked it](http://diveintomark.org/archives/blinks/2004/08/#b20040824215132) people are finally \*finally\* [beginning to take notice](http://del.icio.us/url/bfcde044f4503c3714cee171b583c1d7) of this.

I genuinely think that this is the most exciting thing you could possibly want to do with Atom.

[stpeter](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/), [ralphm](http://ralphm.net/?language=en) and [Bob Wyman](http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/) (and probably others) have been working hard on getting [pubsub](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0060.html) into a workable and working state, developing software that uses it, and feeding back into the spec process. It‚Äôs been a joy to watch.

I already have a hacked version of [Syndirella](http://sourceforge.net/projects/syndirella) which I use that uses [pubsubxmpp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pubsubxmpp/) to connect to pubsub.com‚Äôs XMPP delivery service (via [JEP-0060](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0060.html)) and then parse the Atom content using [Atom.NET](http://atomnet.sourceforge.net/) and provides the items to the user completely transparently. It just looks like any other feed except that it‚Äôs updated by push, not pull, and is updated in real time ‚Äì when a new article is published, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm reading it.

(Ideally I think I‚Äôd have a hacked version of [FeedThing](http://feedthing.sourceforge.net/) to do this instead, just because it would mean an app that could actually redraw without me noticing, but that would mean dusting off my c++ and I‚Äôm not quite that desperate yet. üòâ

This is a big step towards my perfect aggregator. In fact, if Atom starts supporting the concept of a ‚Äúread state‚Äù on items then I could implement a proper distributed aggregator system using Atom over XMPP as its core extremely easily.

I can‚Äôt wait.

Oops, [stpeter points out](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2004-08.html#2004-08-25T13:36) that I should also have credited [pgmillard](http://www.pgmillard.com/blog/), who actually wrote the pubsub spec! Sorry about that Peter!
