What does bug me about it though, is if you’re editing in code view (which I always am), then switch to another view, or (I think I’m right in saying) preview a page, it takes away a lot of the code formatting.

It takes away my nice tabs and replaces them with horrible spaces. It moves lines around. It anihilates some of my indenting. Grrrr!"
