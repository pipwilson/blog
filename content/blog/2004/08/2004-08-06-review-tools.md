I’m a big fan of Alf Eaton’s forays into review tools, and [his new RVW! bookmarklet is ace](http://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/000916.html).

From any item page on amazon you click the bookmarklet and get to add a rating, a heading and a review and can add it to your del.icio.us bookmarks. See [Alf’s del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/hublicious) for an example.

Using an existing system like del.icio.us has its advantages (like, it’s already there) but there are also obvious problems:

- because it creates a new tag per item based on the ASIN your tag list will soon grow to be immense
- the “rating:x%” tags aren’t usable because they don’t create valid del.icio.us URLS, so their usefulness becomes moot
- The “year” tags (like [1977 for Young, Loud and Snotty](http://del.icio.us/hublicious/urn:asin:B000005JBF)) don’t work for some unknown reason

I think the combo of a huge tag list and the partial loss of ratings (since you could still get all of the ratings for a particular item and aggregate them) to get someone’s favourite items is what kills it for me. What’s needed is a centralised system to post things like this. A pure reviews site that accepts REST and XML-RPC and everything and just works, where you can create reviews, and store them, and retrieve them, provide all the info with RDF and get personal recommendations.

How hard can it be? 😉
