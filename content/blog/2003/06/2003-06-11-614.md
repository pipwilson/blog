Incidentally, [Leigh’s intention](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000038.html) for adding other voacabularies to the <acronym title="FOAF-a-matic mk2">FAM2</acronym> seems pretty much the same as mine did:

> I think for the first iteration I’ll simply throw away properties the FOAF-a-Matic doesn’t understand. Then progressively expand the breadth of FOAF data the tool can process. That way there will be enough new code for a second functioning beta.

But that was when I didn’t think it was possible to dynamically generate the Thinlet UI. I’m now not too sure as to how impossible this would actually be. Elements can certainly be generated at run-time, and added to the main UI – selecting the correct widget to use for the options available would be far harder.
