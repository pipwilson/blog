Along with my new digital camera comes the sordid temptation to take pictures of people’s asses and post them on the internet. Sadly, somebody already [beat me to it](http://www.mobileasses.com/cgi-bin/sqldb/dbdisplay.cgi) (via [plasticbag.org](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/06/trivial_entertainment_links.shtml)).

With the release of [Safari 1.0](http://www.apple.com/safari/) came high hopes of functioning generated content, especially in the light of an email I got from [Kynn](http://kynn.com/) only yesterday telling me that generated quotes in Safari beta versions worked for him just fine, leading me to suspect that I just hadn’t been using a recent enough beta of Safari.

bzzzt. challenge. Either generated quotes still don’t work or [Eric Meyer’s test](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/tests/css2/sec12-04-01.htm) is flawed.
