[FeedDemon](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/) first impressions:

- the best GUI of any RSS reader (certainly in terms of polish, at least, my screen however just isn’t wide enough for the three column approach to beat the classic three panes – websites just aren’t designed to be viewed at ~1/3 your monitor width).
- excellent “newspaper view” summary of all the feeds you’re subscribed to
- nice features like bins, listings (try it see what I mean)
- OPML import/export/synching (which worked fine for me but not [Simon Fell](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/06/1317.html))
- Don’t click on the permalinks to my site or you’ll open twenty IE windows. 🙂
