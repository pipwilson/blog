About time I released the work Iâ€™ve been doing on [FOAF-a-matic mk2-pw](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/code/foaf-a-matic2-pw.html).

Sadly thereâ€™s not as much as Iâ€™d like to have had done by now, but thatâ€™s what I get for being given a GameCube and Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker the other week.

I *love* Zelda games. ðŸ™‚
