[Textile4J](http://www.javaslash.org/blog/java/?permalink=357FFCFAAF9C1D305279048E0525A7E1.txt) (<q cite="http://www.javaslash.org/blog/java/?permalink=357FFCFAAF9C1D305279048E0525A7E1.txt">a java port of the Textile humane web text generator from Textism.</q>) has been getting a [reasonable](http://www.rollerweblogger.org/comments/roller/Weblog/credit_where_credit_is_due) [amount](http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2003-06-05&-action=%3C&-orderby=date%20DESC) of [coverage](http://blogs.atlassian.com/rebelutionary/archives/000144.html).

[JTextile](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/code/jtextile.html) beat the rush by two months, works on JDKs below 1.4, and got rather [less coverage](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/23/in_brief_insomniac_edition.html).

The importance of trackbacks, and making millions of comments becomes clear. Fortunately for the real world, googling for “java textile” still returns “garments in Bali” higher than any of the programs mentioned above.

From looking at the source, Textile4J seems clearly based on JTextile, which is directly based on [PyTextile](http://www.diveintomark.org/projects/pytextile/) which in turn is based on the original [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/index.html). All we need now is for Textile4J to introduce some great new tag, Textile to implement it, and the circle will be complete.
