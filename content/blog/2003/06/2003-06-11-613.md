[Leigh Dodds](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/) has [posted an update](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000038.html) on the [FOAF-a-matic mk2](http://www.ldodds.com/wordtin/Wiki.jsp?page=FOAFaMaticMark2), which is really good to see.

The import [vCard](http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html) function I wrote for it was the most basic of the basic, and definitely could do with expanding, and as Leigh mentions, being able to support the [vCard-RDF format](http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf) would be great.

I also agree with him thaat my FOAF file-loading was flawed, but I can forgive myself for two reasons:

1. I think a FOAF file *should* [have a description](http://www.semanticplanet.com/library/DescribingRdfDocuments)
2. Neither mine nor Leighâ€™s approach will correctly handle [Eric Vitellioâ€™s old FOAF file](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/code/ericfoaf.rdf) (his [live FOAF file](http://www.perceive.net/xml/foaf.xml) is very different).

Of course, real FOAF files in the wild are never going to have that description field (although, of course, all FOAF files that pass through the FOAF-a-matic should have it added if it doesnâ€™t exist ðŸ™‚ ), and will thus better handled by Leighâ€™s method, but I can excuse myself again by virtue of a third reason: Iâ€™m rubbish at using Jena to select the nodes I want from a graph.

In other news, it turns out Leigh lives and works in Bath! Ha! I never would have guessed! Bristol is my home town, and seemingly the centre of global FOAF development ([Libby Miller](http://ilrt.org/people/cmlm/) and [Dan Brickley](http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/) are both based in Bristol too). Another big advocate of RDF and the semantic web is Danny Ayers, who lives in Italy, but used to live in Sheffield, which is where I currently live! (the Uni he attended is about a five minute walk from my front door)

I enjoy circles like this, they make me very happy. ðŸ™‚
