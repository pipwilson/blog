The “BBC Headlines for your site” page I was looking for a while ago [turns up here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/shared/bsp/hi/services/htmlsyndication/html/default.stm), which has an absolutely hideous URL, but fortunately for us humans is mapped to <http://www.bbc.co.uk/syndication>.

This comes hot on the heels of [news that the BBC are now providing another six RSS feeds](http://backend.userland.com/2003/06/24#a302), on top of the [previously existing four](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/mt/archives/000359.html) (the two “Front Page” feeds appear to be identical).

Cool beans!

Actually, there are loads and loads of new feeds. Go BBC!
