Iiiinteresting. In my last post on Friday, I inserted `<del>` tags around the first two paragraphs, because they were wrong. This should a) make the text italic and b) draw a line through it, and indeed in Win/IE it does, but not Firebird. Now why’s that I wonder? My CSS looks like this:

```
del {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

However, if I add `display:block` or change the selector to `div * {` then the line-through works as expected. Is this correct behaviour? I wouldn’t have thought so, and if I had any patience with Bugzilla whatsoever, I’d bother find out. As it is, it’s just something to remember.
