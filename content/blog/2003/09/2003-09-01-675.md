Having spent the day doing some maintenance work on one of our legacy sites, I can hand on heart say that old sites using tables for layout are far, far, **far** harder to edit than current sites using CSS for layout.

Even given its weaknesses (the web dev departmentâ€™s favourite this week has been [inline-block](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9458), or lack thereof), give me CSS any day of the week.
