Danger Will Robinson! I have completely broken my support for loading remote PHP files in all my browsers, all, I suspect, a result of reconfiguring my default application handling of PHP files for MozPHP.

Not very good.

OK. I â€˜fess up. MozPHP is fine. The server I was trying to a load a file from was incorrectly configured. Apologies.
