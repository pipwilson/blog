[Christof asked](http://cmeerw.org/blog/151.html) (via [JabRSS growth](http://www.cix.co.uk/%7Ejimh/weblog/2003_08_01_archive.html#106069092050689080) by [Jim](http://www.feetup.org)) and who am I to disappoint? To add to the current [feature request list](http://cmeerw.org/dev/project/list/2/feature) I’d like:

- import/export OCS
- import/export OPML
- ability to force an update instead of having to wait until the next system-wide update
- should be a transport/component instead of Bot user

um, and I think that’s it for new requests! Overall I’m very pleased with [JabRSS](http://cmeerw.org/dev/node/view/7). Because it’s Jabber-based my subscriptions go wherever I go, they’re easy to turn off, it’s easy to use, it’s unobtrusive (depending on your Jabber client settings, obviously). I love it.

With [Charles Miller’s words on voting for bugs](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001541.html) still echoing loudly in my ears, as a technical user I’d like to be able to get more information on feeds which have some kind of error. For me, that currently means:

- [Sergio Umlauf](http://www.freeroller.net/page/umlauf) ([Feed validator results](http://feedvalidator.org/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freeroller.net%2Frss%2Fumlauf))
- [Ben Hammerseley](http://www.benhammersley.com/) ([Feed validator results](http://feedvalidator.org/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.benhammersley.com%2Findex.rdf))
