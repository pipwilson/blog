I was wrong [when I said Firebird was now providing all my needs](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_09_01_blog.html#106329532016716065). This is because Firebird doesn’t currently support Mozilla sidebars.

Under Moz, [my sidebar looks like this](http://philwilson.org/images/sidebar.png). Under Firebird I just only have the default choice of “Downloads”, “Bookmarks” or “History”.

Thanks to [EditCSS](http://editcss.mozdev.org) I now also have an inline Firebird CSS editor which installs itself as a sidebar. Hopefully by picking this apart I can find out what changes are needed to the current Moz XPIs to make them available for Firebird (my J2SE and EE API sidebars are the result of hand-hacked RDF as opposed to the result of installers).
