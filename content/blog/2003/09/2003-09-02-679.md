Following up on those notes to myself, there’s a decent [RDF and Mozilla](http://www.formatvorlage.de/mozine/doc/rdf-slides/index.html) tutorial I just found. It’s pretty ancient, and the examples probably don’t work any more (I’ve not tried yet), but I was messing about with Mozilla a year or so ago, creating XUL documents, learning jpw tp use the chrome stuff and how to call web services from within a webpage, and enjoyed it loads. Since then I’ve found out about RDF and FOAF, and am enjoying that loads too.

If I can find any time (chance would be a fine thing), I’d love to have a play with loading and manipulating RDF with Mozilla. Cross-platform RDF apps built into the browser…..mmmmm.

(of course, this is where [Neil Deakin](http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/) is supposed to be going with [Topicella](http://topicalla.mozdev.org/))
