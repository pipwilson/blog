Some time ago, back in 2002, someone at [mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org) generated [the CSS1 spec with Mozilla bug annotations](http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/bugspecs/REC-CSS1.html).

This kind of thing is absolutely excellent, and definitely the kind of thing developers benefit from. If someone at mozilla.org would please please re-generate this to bring it up to date (it was last generated on 21st of July 2002) and perhaps also generate an annotated CSS2 spec hundreds of web developers across the world would be extremely grateful!
