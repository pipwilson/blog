Inspired by [Jim’s FOAF updates](http://www.feetup.org/blog/2003/Sep/12#FoafUpdates) I’ve taken a five-second look at [my own FOAF file](http://philwilson.org/philfoaf.rdf) and done some minor updates, including adding the new `foaf:gender`.

Jim’s included his [Ecademy](http://www.ecademy.com/) information, but whilst I signed up to it, it was really only because [Danny](http://dannyayers.com/) mentioned that they were using FOAF, and I was curious.

Are any of these things (Ecademy, Friendster etc.) actually worth it? They all seem to require far too much time investement to bother with.
