I enjoyed seeing all of Rome’s ancient sites, but found the people utterly contemptous toward Americans. The Italians in Rome never smiled, unless they were addressing each other. They seemed to try not to make eye contact with us at all. Our group consisted of about 65 people and we all felt the same. This is not an American-friendly people."
