[Yesterday’s link list on thauvin.net](http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2003-09-29) includes a link to the [SWT Designer](http://www.swt-designer.com/). When I was trying to find out which Java GUI toolkit was the quickest to get something up and running in I started with SWT and found my way to the SWT Designer. Visual Café is the most non-intuitive GUI creation tool I’ve ever used (I’m from the Borland school of thought), but this comes a close second.

To be fair it’s only version 1.0, and only *just* been released, too, but still, it’s not just obvious enough for me.

Just my ha’pence worth.
