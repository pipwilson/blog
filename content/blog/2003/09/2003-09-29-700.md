I seem to have been overwhelmed by people saying “display: table-cell doesn’t work in IE” recently. [Once on IBeBloggin](http://blog.vinniegarcia.com/oldstuff/000003.html) and twice at work, by the other two other web developers (who, incidentally, are working on different projects). All today.

`table-cell` **does** work in IE.

For it to work properly in Mozilla you **must** have a containing element which has `display: table` set. IE just doesn’t care.

I’ve chucked up a [working demo here](http://philwilson.org/code/tests/table-cell.html) which is based on the code I wrote the first ever time I used `table-cell`, namely for the [Xurble homepage](http://xurble.sf.net).

This is a working example of the CSS rule `display: table-cell`. There are three spans (marked by red borders) each of which contains an image and has a width ~33% to take up the width of the page.

The containing element is the `body` tag which has `display: table` set and therefore also needs a `width: 100%` rule.

Without an explicitly declared table-row in sight, everything within the element which has `display: table` set (in my case the `body`) will appear on the same row. For multiple rows you’ll probably need a containing element with `display: table-row` for each row.

This is all wrong wrong wrong. See [my later post about why](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_10_01_blog.html#106518224086590820).
