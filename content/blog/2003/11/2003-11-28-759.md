Way to start the working day: A nice cup of tea followed by “Main Offender” by The Hives.

Anyway, despite internal protestations nearly a full year has passed since last December, meaning not only that Christmas is a short while away, but also that my birthday approacheth. All of which means my mind is being drawn inexorably to think about presents. Sad, but true; and whilst a new laptop (or in fact just any old laptop) would be very nice, it’s also just as unlikely.

So here are Some Things Off The Top Of My Head Which I’d Quite Like, on sites other than Amazon:

[Viewtiful Joe](http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,14/gameId,10626/)  
[Kill Bill Vol.1 Soundtrack](http://www.musicbrainz.org/showalbum.html?albumid=153780)  
[Golden Sun 2: The Lost Age](http://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,12/gameId,8962/)  
[Kiki’s Delivery Service](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/KikisDeliveryService-1079951/)  
[Castle in the Sky](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/CastleintheSky-1119957/about.php)
