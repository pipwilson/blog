Saturday night is the UK Webloggers party in London. Which I wonâ€™t be able to make because itâ€™s a four hour train journey away.

One of these days Iâ€™ll make an effort.  
Actually, I might have done if I had heard about it earlier. And knew any other UK Bloggers. ðŸ˜‰

[Details on the party from Funkjunkie](http://www.funjunkie.co.uk/comments.cfm/article=07ce11b4-33e0-4746-a454-693bf9dc25bc) and [Tom Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/11/on_the_uk_webloggers_christmas_party.shtml).
