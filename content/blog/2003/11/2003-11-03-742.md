I feel cheated. [Having felt ecstatic](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_11_01_blog.html#106780989343786868) about the fact I had new context menu commands meaning I could navigate within my sidebar, I find that the context menu doesnâ€™t actually appear for links in the sidebar, thus rendering me impotent to use the extension in the way I wanted.

Alas, the [Netscape Devedge Sidebars](http://devedge.netscape.com/toolbox/sidebars/) remain beyond the reach of usage by mortals in Firebird.
