[Through the eye of a Mac browser](http://www.danvine.com/capture/)

View your site in Safari without having either a Mac or Safari – not bad!

You pass it the URL of the site you want to view in Safari, and on Dan’s Mac it loads the page in Safari, takes a screenshot and posts it to the web, where it remains for 24 hours for you to check.

The machine was getting a complete battering on Wednesday, which is when I saw it, but since then, traffic seems to have calmed down considerably, and the turnaround speed is high.

Match this with the news last week of being able to run [multiple versions of IE on the same Windows machine](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/11/06/ie_x_3/), and web designers’ lives are getting a lot lot easier.

Remember, this is a free service being run by Dan Vine, so please click on the ad links and send him some extra money. This is a great service for those of us who don’t have access to Safari at all.
