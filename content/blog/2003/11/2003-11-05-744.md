Following on from [my post the other day about XUL](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_11_01_blog.html#106773545771471527) there is now an [XUL index page](http://philwilson.org/index.xul) for this site (Danger Will Robinson! Not where you think it’s going to be!), with only basic stuff in it at the moment, and no behaviour, but that’s all stuff I’m working on. I’d love to have a more interactive site via XUL.
