Andy made [an excellent post about the Firebird menubar](http://www.surfmind.com/musings/2003/10/27/index.cfm#index). The Firebird menubar is extremely configurable, and you can put anything just about anywhere, including the Home/Refresh buttons to the same line as the File/Edit menus.

This is great for me, previously I had the main menu bar, navigation/address bar, my bookmarks toolbar (for web dev stuff) and the Web Developer’s Toolbar extension all on different lines. Now I’ve gone through, taking out what I don’t need and am left with two thin lines like this:

The buttons next to my bookmarks are what remains of the Web Developer’s Toolbar once I’d removed what I didn’t need and moved the remaining ones. Absolute genius stuff, and my screen real estate is restored!
