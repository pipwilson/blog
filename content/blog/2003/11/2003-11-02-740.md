[Blogware now ships with functionality for blogging reviews](http://blog.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2003/11/1/5505.html) and using the RVW RSS extension. [Marc Canter says this is great](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/02.html#a1937), whilst I agree in theory, this system uses Amazon as its core item reference, and a cold shiver runs up my spine when I think what Amazon could do to monoplise on this.

The problem of course is that there’s no “open” alternative. There’s [MusicBrainz](http://www.musicbrainz.org/) for music, but what else? Even IMDB are owned by Amazon. I’m surprised they don’t have more product placement (although I’m sure they’re working on integrating their systems).
