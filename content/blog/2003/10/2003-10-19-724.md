The [top twenty-one books](http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/vote/) have been announced in the BBC’s [The Big Read](http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/)

Of that twenty-one, I’ve read twelve and have no particular desire to read the other nine. I must say though that it’s a pretty poor top twenty-one. I mean, “His Dark Materials” by Philip Pullman just *isn’t that good*. These lists are always so predictable. Maybe they should run it anually and not let any of the previous year’s top twenty-one enter; perhaps that way there’s a chance of seeing something else celebrated for a change.

My favourite, for the record, doesn’t appear on the list: A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.
