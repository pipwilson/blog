[Jeffry Zeldman has already written about it](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/1003b.shtml#colorphotobrowser), and so it’s likely that anyone who would be interested will have already seen it, but [iStock’s browse images by colour](http://www.istockpro.com/browse.php) is truly impressive. Enter your colour, hit “View” and you’ll get royalty free images back, matching the colour you entered. I was surprised at just how good it is. That’s high praise.
