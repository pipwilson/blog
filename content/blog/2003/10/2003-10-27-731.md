I’d like to be able to talk in glowing terms about [peopleaggregator.com](http://www.peopleaggregator.com) – it has noble ideals and seems to be A Good Idea. I think they have some bugs to work on though – on first import, it thought I was Ben Hammersely (a fact which, I can assure you, as can Ben, is untrue).

And now, having cleared that up manually and having established some relationships, seems to believe that I am an airport, and that it is not I, but the airport which knows people. Most perplexing.

I’m also not sure what it’s done to my workInfoHompage property.

It’s only alpha code, but still – I thought we had working RDF parsers?
