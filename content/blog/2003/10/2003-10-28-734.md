Ha! That’ll teach me to not read around the subject! Marc has [already written about](http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/10/24.html#a1893) the problems peopleaggregator has been having in picking up who is the main “Person” in a FOAF file. Of course, I already provide `dc:creator` and `foaf:maker` properties to associate my “Person” with the FOAF document, so there shouldn’t be any problem, but as Morten and Libby point out in [the comments](http://comments.blogs.it/comments?u=100198&p=1893&link=http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/10/24.html#a1893) I should also be using `foaf:topic` (I didn’t think this had been decided on as a method of specifying the author of an FOAF file, but there you go).

From what Marc says it looks like they’re **not** parsing the FOAF files with an RDF parser, but some kind of scraper to get the information out; they were looking for the first foaf:name element in the file and finding the main “Person” that way. Apart from using `dc:creator`, `foaf:maker` or `foaf:topic` inside the `<rdf:Description rdf:about="">` element, they could use an algorithm similar to Morten’s [Topic Finder](http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/IFP/) which is <q cite="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/IFP/">A web service for guesstimating the primary FoaF “thing” described in an RDF/XML file.</q>
