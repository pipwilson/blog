Iâ€™ve also been re-subscribing to a load of feeds (my list for the past couple of months has only been about 10-15 feeds long) that Iâ€™d almost forgotten about. Iâ€™d removed my desktop aggregator, but fortunately had kept a list at <http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/syn.xml>

Speak of the devil â€“ when I first checked (about half an hour ago) Firebird 0.7 hadnâ€™t yet been made available. Now it has. Download in progress!
