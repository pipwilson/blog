I meant to blog about this when I first read it at the beginning of last month, but I kept forgetting.

Yozâ€™s [CSS blogwank rant](http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/000840.html) includes a genius solution (read: hack/workaround) for a problem I was having centring my content on <http://philwilson.org>. If you care about CSS, go and read it.
