BBC! Unified login! Now!

Jesus. I must have about ten logins for different parts of the BBC website, and I still need more. How fucking annoying is that? Can’t they have some method of sharing username/passwords across the system? I have logins for the localised message boards, blogging system (which I now can’t even find), iCan, Music meassageboards, and Christ knows what else – Celebdaq and all the other games probably all need individual logins.
