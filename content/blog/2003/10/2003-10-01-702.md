On Saturday 24th September [Yahoo upgraded their messenger service](http://news.com.com/2100-1012-5078361.html), meaning (afaik) that all users had to download the lastest client from the Y! Messenger website. I use Y! IM, but through Jabber. The upgrade broke the transport. Thereâ€™s now a fix to the transport to work with the new authentication scheme.

[Yahoo Messenger Jabber Transport website](http://www.jabberstudio.org/projects/yahoo-transport-2/project/view.php)

The updated version is only in CVS at the moment, but with any luck this means the slow reconnection of Jabber users to their Yahoo accounts.
