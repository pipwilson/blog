Use [CVS](http://www.cvshome.org) ? Use [CVS2RSS](http://laughingmeme.org/cvs2rss/) to keep track of changes to your code? Moving your repository over to [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) ? You’ll be wanting [svnlog](http://0x2a.no-ip.org/mt/archives/000044.html) then.

> It’s an eXSLT that transforms subversion (svn) log XML files into vaild RSS 2.0 feeds. Get it [here](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/goodies/svnlog-xslt.tgz).  
> It shows revision number and author in the RSS’s title; commit message, date and changed files in the description. There are some goodies in there, like links to the changed files and expansion of the file’s status. If you need a RSS feed for your Subversion repository, have a look.
