Fortunately I clearly don’t have any readers who are very interested in `table-cell`, because if I had, they’d have torn me to pieces on my post about how [it does work in IE](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_09_01_blog.html#106484745449435733).

Because it doesn’t.

[Steve Clay](http://mrclay.org/) [wisely pointed out](http://blog.vinniegarcia.com/oldstuff/000003.html) that my example works in IE because it incorrectly honours the width that I set on the spans, thus making it only **look** as though `table-cell` actually works.

If I modify my example so that the first cell doesn’t have a set width and contains multiple lines of text, the other cells which are meant to be on the same row are clearly moved down instead of staying where they are. [See what I mean here](http://philwilson.org/code/tests/table-cell-revisited.html).

I apologise and hold myself up as a victim of IE’s crapness.
