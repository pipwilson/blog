I’ve written a lot tonight and it’s getting late, but to wrap up:

[No Fishing](http://bitworking.org/news/No_Fishing) – yes.  
[Semantics, HTML, XHTML, and Structure](http://brainstormsandraves.com/articles/semantics/structure/) – this is excellent stuff for educating the unwashed masses of web developers who still think tables are the be-all and end-all and have no idea of how to mark up a page properly (at work we now have a web *designer* doing web *development* – my life just got harder).
