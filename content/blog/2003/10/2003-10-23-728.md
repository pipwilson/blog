[Dave Gormanâ€™s Googlewhack adventure](http://davegorman.com/dggwa.html)

Dave Gorman is a very funny man. A stand-up comedian who for the last year or two has been busy telling stories. Even better, heâ€™s been telling real-life stories; even better *than that* heâ€™s been telling true stories about his own life (these all seem to frequently occur after a bottle of tequila). Although he makes a living from making us laugh whilst telling us of his high-jinks thereâ€™s also an extraordinary pathos to his shows â€“ you know he means it.

Oh yeah, and heâ€™s really funny. ðŸ™‚ Go see his show. Dave Gormanâ€™s Googlewhack Adventure is touring now and they give away free badges. What more could you want?
