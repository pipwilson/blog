[FileZilla](http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/) has been getting no little coverage in the blogging world over the last few days by being featured in not only [Mark Pilgrim’s linklog](http://diveintomark.org) but also on [Erik Thauvin’s daily roundup](http://www.thauvin.net/blog/).

Shortly after I started working for [iBase](http://www.ibase.com), about twelve months ago, I realised that all FTP activity between ourselves and clients (and there’s a surprising amount) was being done via command-line (and of course most clients had no idea what was going on). I instantly recommended FileZilla and we’ve been using as our FTP client of choice ever since. It’s a great piece of software; not just because it’s free, but also because it’s easy to use.

Use FileZilla, kids!
