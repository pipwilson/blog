Two Mozilla-related things I almost didn’t notice:

- an article that appeared at the end of October: [Create Web applets with Mozilla and XML](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-appmozx/) (which is actually very worthy, despite using the dreaded “applet” word)
- a new book: [Rapid Application Development with Mozilla](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131423436/qid=1066418934/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-8694728-2576004?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) ([same on amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131423436/ref=sr_aps_books_1_1/202-6493130-2502247))

Both of these via [David Baron’s blog](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/doron/)

If ever you find yourself lacking something to do, just flick over to the [list of mozillazine.org weblogs](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/) and have a browse.
