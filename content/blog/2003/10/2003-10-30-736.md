A new, excellent site full of everything you wanted to know about browsers, CSS and javascript by the master of all three.

Also contains the gem that IE/Mac is a <q cite="http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/explorer5mac.html">Bug ridden crash prone piece of junk</q>.

In amongst all these pages is an interesting [Javascript alternative to the CSS-based Fahrner Image Replacement](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/fir.html). After the recent <acronym title="A List Apart">ALA</acronym> [article on why we shouldn’t use the FIR](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fir/) (because it breaks screen readers), this is a welcome alternative, although it still needs hard testing of the kind ALA gave to the CSS version to make sure it works properly.
