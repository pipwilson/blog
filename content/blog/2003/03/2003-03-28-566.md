I want [my new server](http://www.memset.com/fullserver.php).

I also want a Java version of [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) (JTextile? Hello, [Humble Narrator](http://hivelogic.com/)).

And how about this:  
from a single Jabber account, I want to be able to auto-generate a comprehensive FOAF file.

1. from JID (using vCard) [JID2FOAF (php)](http://dougal.gunters.org/jabfoaf/jid2foaf.html)
2. from roster (using vCards) [Roster2FOAF (php)](http://dougal.gunters.org/jabfoaf/roster2foaf.html)
3. from MSN contacts (contact details) [msn2foaf (perl)](http://chimpen.com/msn2foaf/)
4. from exisiting OPML file (using autodiscovery)

in Java.

I also want Joggle to support iCalendar so I can have my appointments wherever I go, and be notified via Jabber (if necessary via SMS using the ICQ interface (if it still works these days)). Is this too much to ask?
