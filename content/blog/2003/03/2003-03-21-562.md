The ‘get out’ list of blogs I regularly read (over on the right) is now generated on the fly, using javascript, from an [OPML](http://www.opml.org/ "Outline Processor Markup Language") file created using the “export” function of [Syndirella](http://www.yole.ru/projects/syndirella/ "RSS Aggregator"). I got tired of having my blogroll out of sync with my RSS reader, now a single file upload and voila! the same.

 It’s cross browser, which is great, but as Mark Pilgrim mentioned yesterday in his article about <acronym title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</acronym> types, it [will cause problems](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/03/19/dive-into-xml.html "case-sensitive problems") if and when I ever want to create valid <abbr title="Extensible HTML">XHTML</abbr> 2.0.

It still needs to be sorted alphabetically (because Syndirella doesn’t support sorting its feeds), but I just wanted something quick – sorting can come later.

The script is based on one found at probably the best javascript resource on the web – [ppk’s javascript section](http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/ "Peter-Paul Koch"). Everything I know about Javascript I learnt there.

<ins datetime="2003-03-21T17:09:00Z" title="after a bit of thought">→I suspect this sorting lark may be more complex than anticipated, and whilst still very doable, I’d rather keep the code simple. Unsorted it is. It’s more fun like that anyway.</ins>  
<ins datetime="2003-03-22T01:05:00Z" title="almost forgot to mention">→I almost forgot to mention that whilst the file kept its `opml` extension, it wouldn’t be loaded by either IE6/Win or Mozilla 1.3 – only when I renamed the file to have an `xml` extension did it start to work.</ins>  
<ins datetime="2003-03-22T23:22:49">→Now ordered alphabetically by removing all my subscriptions in Syndirella and then importing back from the xml file. Not an ideal solution, but works in the short term.</ins>
