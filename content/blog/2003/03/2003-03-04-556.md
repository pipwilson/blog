My company has a new website. None of the usual web developers were involved. As a result, it doesn’t validate, is poorly-formed, uses tables for layout, has unclosed attribute values, and uses the `<font>` tag.

It just doesn’t get much worse. It doesn’t use animated gifs, <del datetime="2003-03-23T23:28:00Z">but it \_does\_ have a `<marquee>` tag on the front page</del>. And the navigation on the front page is different to the rest of the site.

The guy who wrote it owns Jakob Neilsen’s [Designing Web Usability](http://www.useit.com/jakob/webusability/ "A good book"). His code isn’t even valid HTML 4 Transitional, and even Frontpage can produce that these days.

So depressing.
