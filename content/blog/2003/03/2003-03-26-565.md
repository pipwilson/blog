[Weapons of mass seduction](http://media.guardian.co.uk/marketingandpr/story/0,7494,922189,00.html "Porn and the war")? Pff, next thing you’ll be telling me is that guns are sold to gun-totin’, battle-lovin’ (sad and lonely) rednecks using women posing in bikinis firing AK-47s! Please! We’re far more civilised than that!

Enlightenment, my first favourite window manager for Linux [isn’t dead](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1871351&forum_id=6427 "E17?"). Apparently. (It’s sure been doing a good job of pretending.) It’d be great to see the E team release a rip-roaring new version, kicking the other WMs into touch with all-aliased, perfectly skinned, amazing ease-of-use everything.

Why won’t it happen? Because it’s probably been [the longest product development cycle since Netscape 6](http://2lmc.org/spool/?id=1994 "crackmonkeys say so"). That’s why.
