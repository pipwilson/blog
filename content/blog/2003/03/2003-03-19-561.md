[Work,](http://ibs001.colo.firstnet.net.uk/wildlife/home/index.jsp "Not my doing") [work](http://ibs001.colo.firstnet.net.uk/heritage/home/index.jsp "not me either") and [more work](http://www.theartshopper.com/browse/ "pffff").

None designed by me, hence the table-ness of everything.

My current job, to upgrade [this site](http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/ShetlandMuseum/controller "Shetlands Museum"), means **out** go the `table`s, `font` tags, spacer GIFs, and **in** come [tamed lists](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/taminglists/ "taming lists: a list apart"), flexible layouts and general niceness.

The problem, of course, is that Iâ€™ve only got a week from beginning to end to get it all converted and working.
