Haven’t we all wanted to [send lynx text instead of images](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0203c.shtml#cssbg "text no images") so we can keep great design and great accessibility?

[Ben Hammersely loves linked folders in Eclipse](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/20030313.html#140800 "Eclipse Schmelipse"), and many other people just adore Eclipse in general. Neither I nor any of the dev team I work with have ever really got to grips with it in a satisfactory manner (OK, one of the guys uses Emacs on his Win2K machine, but we won’t count him). It just seems to take so long to understand and start being productive with. Is there something we’re missing?

(Incidentally, just about all the other developers, including me, use [Editplus](http://www.editplus.com "a good text editor"))
