We all know that the BBC has had RSS autodiscovery links on their main pages for ages now (for example, on <http://news.bbc.co.uk/>) but [the BBC Magazine section](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/default.stm) has an [FAQ](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3050762.stm) which contains this:

> Is there an RSS feed for Magazine?
> 
> Yes. Itâ€™s available at [ this page ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/syndication/feeds/news/ukfs_news/magazine/rss091.xml)

RSS! Mentioned on one of the main pages of the BBC website! Astonishing!
