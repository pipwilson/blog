Buried in the comments of [Mark Pilgrimâ€™s latest post about aggregators and power laws](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/01/aggregators) is [this little gem of a Bash script](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/12/01/aggregators#c004682) which, given the name of your RSS file and an apache access log will return a list of the number of different user-agents who have accessed your file, ordered by the number of user-agents

So for me:

`grep /rssify.php /var/log/apache/access.log | cut -d " " -f 1,12- | sort | uniq | cut -d " " -f 2- | cut -d "/" -f 1 | sort |uniq -c | sort -gr | head -25`

and you can swap `grep` for `zgrep` to search through the gzipped archives (i.e. grep /rssify.php /var/log/apache/access.log.1.gz etc.)
