My girlfriend’s just received some SMS spam ([this one in fact](http://www.grumbletext.co.uk/subjects/smsspambpqvoicemailmessage.htm)), and came to show it to me not because she was going to call it, but because the “sent” date is approximately five hours in the future.

Of course, a quick google of the contents retrieved the page on [Grumbletext](http://www.grumbletext.co.uk/) I linked to above, which tells of people who even *called the number* and were charged £11 for the privilege. Honestly, it’s almost as bad as [this woman](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3235471.stm).

Anyway, for all those receiving SMS spam in the UK, here’s what the GrumbleText guys recommend:

> Our advice: 1) report it to ICSITS on 0800 500212 and 2) delete it – you should only consider attempting to ‘unsusbscibe’ if you start getting loads of the same text – services tend to send out in batches over a period of a few days so be patient and see if they die off.. Oh, and the last main way that we know they use to get hold of your number is: if you call one of these so called 090-type ‘prize’ numbers, you will often be asked – in order to be able to ‘claim’ your ‘prize’- to input using the phone keypad a friend’s mobile number. If you make one up, as many people must do, well, it may turn out its yours, and that’s why you started suddenly getting a stream of junk!

In addition, despite our harsh spam filters at work, I’ve just started getting a couple of spam mails a week arriving in my Inbox which is pretty surprising seeing as it’s not given out to anyone outside the company ever. I suppose it must have just popped up on the brute force “possibly valid email”-ometer.
