I’ve known about [the Mozilla ActiveX project](http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/mozilla.htm) for ages (genuinely one of the best and most useful things anyone could be doing with Mozilla), but never got around to trying it at all. But it’s this easy to replace the IE component embedded in apps with Gecko? Wow. Bring it on!
