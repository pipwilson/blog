[Just say NO to Microsoft](http://microsoft.toddverbeek.com/) (via [Cheah Chu Yeow](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2003/12/09/just_say_no_to_microsoft.php)) is a site listing alternatives to MS software for all (as far as I can tell) of the domains they have a product in: from OS to word processor; WebTV to Exchange. It’s nice to have a list that you can point people at when they ask “well, just what else \*is\* there?”. It’s a shame (but unsurprising when you consider the breadth) that some of the alternatives pages are lacking in detail due to limited author experience.

Perhaps people who’ve used packages which are, for example, alternatives to Visio could give the author some details?
