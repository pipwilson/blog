I’ve come home to Bristol for Christmas (wonder if I’ll see any of the [ILRT](http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/) folks like [Libby Miller](http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/people/libby/) or [Dan Brickley](http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/) doing their Christmas shopping?), and what do I find? I find that not only has my Mum bought a new computer (a 2.2GHz Dell with half a gig of RAM!), but that it connects to the Internet via the 802.11g wifi router sitting in my bedroom! Bloody hell, I wish **my** house was like this! Talk about way to make a boy feel jealous!
