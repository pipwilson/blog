Interesting looking at Erikâ€™s news today to see several Java bulletin-board type things covered.

In a totally unrelated, but nevertheless coincidental move, I rewrote some of the [Xurble frontpage](http://xurble.sf.net) over the weekend, and hope to get a clean version up over the next few days.

Unlike the ones Erik links to (which seem to be well-planned out, carefully architected etc.), lots of the Xurble code grew organically, and, FWIW, works very nicely thankyouverymuch. Not to mention that it supports just about anything you can think of. ðŸ˜‰

Oh, and Xurble is now years old. ðŸ™‚
