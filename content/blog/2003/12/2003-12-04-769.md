To match [Through the eye of a Mac](http://www.danvine.com/capture/) is [Through the eye of Konqueror](http://kcapture.eadz.co.nz/) which does almost exactly the same thing, but for the linux browser Konqueror.

It looks as though it’s not getting many hits at the moment, although if they do, they may want to implement some kind of visible queueing system as on “Through the eye of a Mac”, or one of two things will happen:

- a) their machine will explode in flames
- b) people will wonder why the process time is so long, and leave in a huff, damning them for a shitty service.

As far as I know, both Safari and Konqueror use KHTML as their core rendering engine, so they should both render in pretty much the same way, but there are also Safari-specific additions Apple have made to their rendering engine which won’t make it into KDE for quite a while yet (for example, the [rendering of the XUL box model](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2003_10.html#004257)) which you can keep up with on [Dave Hyatt’s blog](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/).
