Interestingly [Local News](http://www.local-news.net/) (“your worldwide local newspaper”, as it calls itself) has a “gossip” page powered by [Localfeeds](http://www.localfeeds.com/). Select your location, hit the “gossip” tab and you get what they call “News from local bloggers…”.

News? From bloggers? More like inane prattle. This may be taking the “blogging as journalism” meme a bit too seriously.
