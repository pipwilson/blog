I’ve noticed that [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/ "Jason Kottke's weblog") has found Joggle (remaindered links).

Since Blogger doesn’t support comments, I don’t have the time to set up MovableType, Textpattern or anything similar and Joggle’s not live yet, the easiest way to find out more/ask questions is via the [Joggle Forum](https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=71782) on sourceforge (yes we sold our souls, no we don’t care).

It’s possibly also worth noting that despite the claims of the sourceforge CVS summary page, code does actually exist, which is [browsable here](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/joggle/v1/).
