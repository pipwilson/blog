[Blogger](http://www.blogger.com "Blogger") [breaks my HTML](http://www.htmlhelp.com/cgi-bin/validate.cgi?url=http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/&warnings=yes&input=yes "WDG Validation Results").

My template is well-formed, and valid XHTML.

The source of my blog entries is well-formed and valid XHTML.

The output of my entry inserted into the template is broken XHTML.

Somewhere along the line, <del>Blogger</del><ins>Tripod</ins> converts my opening and closing `body` tags into `BODY` tags, `</b>` tags into `</B>` tags and my `<blockquote>` tags into `<Blockquote>` tags, which means my page is no longer valid (since it leaves the case of the opening tags alone, giving me a million and one “invalid nesting” errors), which, pretty obviously, I’d really like it to be.
