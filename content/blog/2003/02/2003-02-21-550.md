Just like everyone else in the world is probably now saying, [ESPN](http://msn.espn.go.com/main.html "ESPN") have redesigned to use an *almost* all <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> layout.

This is good news.

Firstly because it’s another big site turning to use CSS-only layout (see: [Wired](http://www.wired.com), [W3C](http://www.w3c.org), [Netscape devedge](http://devedge.netscape.com/)), but secondly, and perhaps more importantly, because it’s a Microsoft site, and that means they must be confident that the majority of the visitors to the site are going to have proper CSS-compliant browsers. Come in Netscape 4, your time is up.

With luck this could mean that tools like Frontpage might start producing [ValidHTML](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValidHtml) **and** making people use CSS instead of tables, font tags, and all other such horrors.

As [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0203b.shtml#espn) points out, the ESPN site still has it’s faults, but it’s a massive boost.
