This might be neat.

Joggle auto-annotation:

- maintain a list of a) words and b) links that are automatically replaced when they feature in a blog entry (e.g. ‘Google’ gets replaced with ‘&lt;a href=”http://www.google.com” title=”Google” alt=”Link to Google”&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;’ )
- provide an “annotate” link which allows you to review the words of the entry you’re making and define new annotation definitions.
- a public and private annotation list would be nice, with the public list being a subset of the group of all users’ annotation lists. This should be done automatically, so that when a word reaches a critical level, it gets transferred into the public list
