[GenJar](http://genjar.sourceforge.net/) is an incredibly useful tool for people like me, who uses masses of libraries during development, chopping and changing between different toolkits and not removing the jars no longer used.

In fact it does more than that, recursively examining the class files used by your app so that your final JAR only includes the classes you actually use!

Looks like good stuff for keeping your total deployment size down.
