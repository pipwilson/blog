Itâ€™s not often I scroll to the bottom of my blog, but if you do so youâ€™ll spot exactly what I did â€“ Google ads. I wouldnâ€™t mind if Iâ€™d chosen them to be there, but I didnâ€™t. I suppose itâ€™s a small plus that they seem to actually have some relation to my blog, but still this is yet another reason why I really need to get my arse into gear and move everything over to Minty running on <http://philwilson.org> (which is all just demo layout at the mo).

et voila. another &lt;noscript&gt; tag and they disappear. Exactly the same technique I use to stop Tripod Popups appearing. It makes my HTML completely invalid, but whoâ€™s counting? ðŸ˜‰
