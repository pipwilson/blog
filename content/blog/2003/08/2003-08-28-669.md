I only have dial-up at home, and Iâ€™ve been terribly busy at work, so Iâ€™m a week or so behind, my apologies.

Following up on his original CSS tabs (which I copied for the effect on <http://philwilson.org>), [Dan Cederholm shows us](http://www.simplebits.com/code/minitab_shapes.html) how to use images to achieve a very neat effect

Somehow in all my web design wanderings, Iâ€™d managed to miss [Pseudo/Design](http://www.itnextgen.net/pseudo/index.php) and [Redemption in a Blog](http://blog.codefront.net/), two weblogs well worth a read.

To finish this post, [something from Richard Herring that made me laugh](http://www.richardherring.com/warmingup/warmingup.php?id=282). I suspect you have to be British to appreciate it properly. ðŸ˜‰
