Iâ€™m halfway through my week off, and have blagged Internet access for a few hours, mainly to sort of stare at my Inbox. I only subscribe to about three mailing lists, and itâ€™s already going to take me several hours to catch up on what Iâ€™ve received since Saturday, let alone what Iâ€™ll have by the time I get home.

I think Iâ€™ll save it all for next Monday.

I pity [poor Danny Ayers](http://dannyayers.com/archives/001653.html).

In other news, Iâ€™ve clearly taken the best week of the year, weather-wise off of work, as [temperatures soar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3127669.stm) across the country, and Iâ€™m spending the week on the south coast, although on the day I decided to spend on Brighton beach ([webcam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/southerncounties/webcams/brighton_camera_pop_up.shtml), [wifi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3068915.stm)) it was covered in miserable mist, and the terror that is the British Rail System stopped me from getting back to Hastings (for that is where Iâ€™m staying â€“ highest suicide rate in the UK, trivia kids, donâ€™t say I never give you anything) for for about five hours. I have however learnt my lesson and will be spending the rest of the week as I began it, enjoying the sun and squinting to see my laptop screen. ðŸ™‚
