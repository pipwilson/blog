The Mozilla [XUL Periodic Table](http://www.hevanet.com/acorbin/xul/top.xul) is great stuff. If you want to see what XUL elements are available to you, how to use them, and what they look like with different attributes, this is the place to go (via [Chu Yeow Cheah](http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2003/08/31/xul_periodic_table.php)).

Mozilla’s XUL is really simple stuff. When you tie it in with [Mozilla’s built-in support for XML-RPC](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xmlrpc/) and SOAP (check the articles on [Using the Mozilla SOAP API](http://developer.apple.com/internet/webservices/mozillasoapapi.html), and [Mozilla SOAP/Google API Demos](http://www.scottandrew.com/weblog/googleapi)), you’re well on the way to creating decent cross-platform applications. The biggest problem of course, is that we’re *still* waiting for the [XRE](http://www.xulplanet.com/aaron/notebook/mozilla/xre.html "XUL Runtime Environment") (although I guess the [GRE](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/embedding/GRE.html "Gecko Runtime Environment") is usable).
