Because I’m in the process of redesigning my web site, I’ve been re-reading a lot of old design articles (mainly a load of CSS articles; the lessons of which, I was quite glad to discover, I mostly knew by heart).

Some interesting new stuff (for me at least!) though: [Help the Googlebot understand your site](http://www.scribbling.net/Help_the_Googlebot_understand_your_web_site), [Nine things you can do to make your web site better](http://www.scribbling.net/nine_things_you_can_do_to_make_your_web_site_better) and the IBM [Web Design Guidelines](http://www-3.ibm.com/ibm/easy/eou_ext.nsf/Publish/572)

Whilst looking around, I also came across this quote:

> - Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing.
> - The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding.

Which was apparently [published in AppleDirect in August 1989](http://asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html) – I wonder if this is still true? One of the developers at work uses Emacs for everything (motto: if it hasn’t got a fifteen-key macro command it’s not worth doing) in Windows on the premise that it’s much faster than using a standard programmer’s text editor.
