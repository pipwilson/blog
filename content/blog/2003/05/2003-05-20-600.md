I completely hate bandwagon-jumping and just linking to other people’s stories, and becoming one of the thousands of blogging sheep who wait for something cool, and then **all** link to it.

Sadly for me, today [Simon Fell](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/index.html "pocketsoap.com") [links](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1273.html) to [an announcement](http://www.usercreations.com/weblog/2003/05/19.html#a223) in the [Spring](http://www.usercreations.com/spring/ "an innovative, web-inspired desktop") weblog about preliminary <acronym title="Friend of a friend">FOAF</acronym> support.

Now I don’t have a Mac, but Spring looks like the kind of app I’d like – a natural, intuitive method of linking and performing actions on people, places, and sources of information. It certainly looks like the way user-centric apps *should* be. As soon as I can, I think I’ll see if I can try this out on the Mac in our office. (Of course, there’s always a slight worry in that Andrew Orlowski endorses it – see bottom of [Spring homepage](http://www.usercreations.com/spring/))

Simon [also reports](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/05/1274.html) on a new feature in Syndirella, [toast](http://www.groovymother.com/archives/2003/05/19/syndirella_now_w.html) – that is, a small popup that displays the latest feed update in a window such as that MS Messenger displays when you get new mail (<acronym title="for what it’s worth">FWIW</acronym> [Feedreader](http://www.feedreader.com "another RSS aggregator") also does this). There’s a download available, as well as diffs between this version and the original. There may be a problem with the licensing, as the code for “toast” is from [The Genghis Project](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/genghis/ "a set of extensions built on top of .NET and integrated with WinForms "), the license of which [may be incompatible with the <acronym title="GNU public license">GPL</acronym>](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndirella/message/344), but at the moment it looks A-OK.

I have a personal interest in Syndirella, because I intend to use it as a testbed for learning C#, just as soon as I get around to installing VS.NET ….
