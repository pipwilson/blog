[BIO: A vocabulary for biographical information](http://internetalchemy.org/vocab/bio/0.1/) and [Friend of a friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/).

[The GEDCOM Standard](http://www.gendex.com/gedcom55/55gcappa.htm) and any of one, or a mixture, of [Simple API for GEDCOM](http://www.citnames.com/isacat/2002/sag/sag.htm), [GedML](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/michael.h.kay/gedml/), [GEDCOM to DAML](http://www.daml.org/2001/01/gedcom/).

Does anyone see where I’m going here?

Possibly converting GEDCOM to DAML to use [Jena](http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena.htm) instead of the [Stanford RDF API](http://www-db.stanford.edu/~melnik/rdf/api.html), and then using XSLT on the resultant XML to produce good FOAF using the BIO vocab.

And voila, your family in your FOAF file. Why you’d want to do so is a different matter.

Incidentally, I’ve seen a lot of talk (esp. on rdfweb-dev and rdf-interest) about GEDCOM -&gt; RDF but no concrete code, hence why I thought I’d have a go.
