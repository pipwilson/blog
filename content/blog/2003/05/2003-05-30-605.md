`<thinking-out-loud>`

I’m slightly confused.

When entering the details of your friends in the [Foaf-a-matic2](http://www.ldodds.com/wordtin/Wiki.jsp?page=FOAFaMaticMark2), you can enter either their email address in the mbox field, or an <span class="caps">SHA</span>’d value.

But then what happens if you have “hide email addresses” selected?

This means that the value in the email address box gets encrypted via <span class="caps">SHA</span>. So all addresses you entered which were already encrypted get encrypted again. Surely this is an oversight?

Should there be a separate field completely for <span class="caps">SHA</span>’d mbox values?

I think this is the only decent way around it.

That way, when loading <span class="caps">FOAF</span> files, if you’d previously encrypted their addresses, those encrypted values get loaded, and don’t get double-encrypted when you re-save the file.
