Ian Davis [writes](http://internetalchemy.org/2003/05/foafNews.html) that Dan Brickley’s proposed [FoafNews](http://rdfweb.org/topic/FoafNews) is just RDFNews.

I think he’s right. Why use the FOAF name in this? This is the point where I’d like to use, for the first time ever, the phrase ….. (fanfare please) … [FUD](http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/9267/fuddef.html).
