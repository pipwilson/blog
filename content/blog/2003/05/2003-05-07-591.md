They say the Net expands as necessary to fill your free time, and this has been true for me for years, and with the advent of RSS aggregators there’s no excuse for anyone to have a moment’s free time; I’m subscribed to thirty feeds, but there are people who subscribe to three hundred, or more.

But recently I’ve found this not being the case, in fact, the opposite; now, I don’t even have enough time for the computer at all, let alone keeping up with the virtual joneses. More quality time with ‘er indoors means that (through no fault of my own) I’m kept up to date on the dalliance of [Kat Slater](http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/kat_s_biog.shtml) and [Alfie Moon](http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/alfie_m_biog.shtml) in [Eastenders](http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/). Some people would say this is healthy, I say “where’s my personal coding time?”. I need a laptop.
