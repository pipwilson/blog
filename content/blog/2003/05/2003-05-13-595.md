RSS Bandit. [Found it](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=cb8d3173-9f65-46fe-bf17-122e3703bb00)

I had a dream last night. It was about RDF and the semantic web. It was all about automated agents talking, relating; RDF documents find out stuff about other RDF document and becoming cleverer. They link together and become a gestalt entity, greater than the sum of their parts.

There were plain old documents in it too. They were like farmyard animals, chewing the cud.

Incidentally, I didn’t find RSS Bandit via Google. I found it because its author posted a link on a weblog I read.

Searching for “RSS Bandit” on Google produces hundreds of links to pages mentioning it, but none to either its homepage, or its gotdotnet workspace (there’s a link to an old MSDN article about it). The link to the workspace may be on any number of those returned pages, or all of them (it’s not linked to on the first page returned). This is normal Google usage. And it doesn’t work any more.
