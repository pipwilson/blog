A summary:

[Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com) has redesigned his website, and it looks absolutely beautiful. Is this finally an end to the proliferation of white-only websites (I have an excuse – I have no design talent)?

A few days behind, but still, [XHTML 2.0 considered hopeful](http://tantek.com/log/2003/05.html#L20030508t1620). It’ll be so nice to see many of the broken facets of XHTML 2.0 fixed.

It’s also (vaguely) interesting to see the CSS debate continue [on](http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/dave/archives/2003_05.html#003191) and [on](http://philringnalda.com/blog/2003/05/yet_another_css_slam.php) and [on](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/193866.html).

FOAF and co-depiction gets a [mention](http://viswanathgondi.blogspot.com/) on a completely unrelated website, which I think is a good sign of its growing popularity (or at least mindshare).

[Dare](http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/Carnage4Life/diary/'s)‘s RSSBandit is actually looking really good now, and as soon as I find out where to download it from, I’ll be trying it out.

<ins>Oh. It’ looks like it’s not out yet.</ins>

Slightly more interestingly, [Jena](http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena.htm) includes a tool called “schemagen” which takes in an RDF schema and produces an appropriate vocabulary class in Java. Excellent! I was really expecting Jena to be much much harder to use, but it *appears* to be fairly simple.

p.s. I’ve just spotted a [design](http://www.projetsurbain.com/blog/hyatt/) suggested for Dave Hyatt’s website. I think I’ll convert to CSS and steal it (using `-moz-border-radius` to do the corners for gecko-browsers).
