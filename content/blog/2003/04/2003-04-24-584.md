Number one RSS aggregator request: search.

I knew someone, in one of the feeds I subscribe to, had mentioned using the `:before` pseudo-element in CSS, I need to know who, and why, and to re-read their explanation. Could I find it? Could I buggery.

My aggregator is [Syndirella](http://www.yole.ru/projects/syndirella/), and seemed to remember that when I tried [SharpReader](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/cat_sharpreader.html), it had this feature. Download, import [my OPML file](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/syn.xml). Wait for the download and update (this was all via a 56kbps modem). Look for a search option. No such luck.

Someone, please, implement “search in these blogs” or something similar. You’ll be saving us all an awful lot of trouble.
