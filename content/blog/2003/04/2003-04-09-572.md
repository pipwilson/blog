I’m terribly busy.

A big fuss about [SharpReader ](http://www.hutteman.com/sharpreader/ "Another aggregator")(<acronym title="Yet Another 3-Paned .Net Aggregator">YA3PDNA</acronym>) currently fills the world, and the developer of Syndirella [talks about stopping development](http://home.yole.ru/weblog/archives/000091.html).

Personally I think Syndirella is far superior, just because it’s much simpler to use and follows normal UI practice where SharpReader doesn’t. It would be a huge shame if Syndirella was to stop where it was.

[ieSpell](http://www.iespell.com/), a spell-checker for us in IE is very useful. It would be nice to see something like OmniWeb’s in-line spellchecking in the next version of IE.

The [Mozilla Guide for Web Developers](http://gemal.dk/mozilla/mozdev.html) is very good, especially the info about [LiveHTTPHeaders](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/) which is something I’ve been looking for for ages (so that I can see the headers when doing local testing instead of having to upload a webapp to a server).
