It seems the few offocial <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds ([list](http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/mt/archives/000359.html)) have now disappeared (they all [404](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5)).

Does anyone know when they might either be back, or replaced with a coherent syndication strategy from the BBC?

The [BBC Syndication](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/services/syndication/default.stm) page hasn’t been updated in about forever, although I seem to recall reading about the launch of their “our headlines on your pages” for schools and other like facilities last week. Any ideas?

It seems it was just a temporary thing, but there were definitely a number of hours yeserday when they were down but everything else was working. In slightly better news, a “BBC Insider” left a comment here saying the BBC have no intention of taking them down. Hurrah!
