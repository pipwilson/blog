Sam Ruby’s [last](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1353.html) [few](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1354.html) [posts](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1355.html) about RSS past and future help to explain why it needs namespaces (or some other change) in the future, which helped clear [my previous confusion](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_04_06_blog.html#92422163). That makes sense, but for weblog aggregation? I’d still argue against a `body` tag, but what do I know?

I agree with Bill Kearney here, <q cite="http://www.ideaspace.net/users/wkearney/archives/entries/000282.html" lang="en">[Before we bother with extending all this, let’s get the core stuff working first.](http://www.ideaspace.net/users/wkearney/archives/entries/000282.html)</q>. I think it would be fair to say that RSS is mainly used for website aggregation, and seeing as the apps that are out there don’t even agree on how RSS should be parsed, and the specs are ‘conversational’ (I read that somewhere, probably in a comment on Sam Ruby’s weblog, and liked it – conversational specs, heh), it might be nice to have some ratification and concreting of what we’ve got. Not to slow stuff down, but so we can draw a line and say **this** is the version websites should use and **this** is how it’s supposed to work, and **this** is what you’re doing wrong (of course anyone who wants to can use the latest in RSS feeds, and implement changes as they see fit – Sam does this well by providing a whole range of RSS versions for his site).

The part I disagree with most in all of this is that of allowing relative links. It’s probably the single most annoying practical problem around. There’s no consensus amongst RSS publishers or consumers on how relative links should be resolved. With respect to the server root? With respect to the `<link>` tag? With respect to the actual RSS feed?

<acronym title="As Far As I’m Concerned">AFAIC</acronym> links should be absolute or begin with a ‘/’ and be relative to the webserver root. How else do you specify where it should be? Relative links blow chunks.
