Okay, I ‘fess up. I don’t get it.

Why should I bother using `xhtml:body` when I could just as well be using `content:encoded` ? What’s the inherent benefit? I don’t buy the bandwidth cost answer, either.

There’s a nice [short overview](http://www.brockerhoff.net/bb/viewtopic.php?p=382#382) which probably summarises all the main points, and back when it was all new I didn’t get it either, but I wasn’t publishing RSS then, so thought I was just missing something. Now I am publishing, and I still don’t get it.

Sure you get a namespace, and it’s probably *nicer*, in a web egalitarian way, but is it actually **better**?

So what’s the deal? Why should I change my RSS feed to support `xhtml:body` ?
