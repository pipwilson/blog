A quick (and imperfect) workaround for the lack of Blogger RSS feeds is the service provided by [Voidstar](http://www.voidstar.com/rssify.php), which necessitates you add a `<span>` into your main template, and then generates your RSS feed for you.

Not a bloody bad idea given that a number of “A-list” people have said they won’t read a website which doesn’t provide an RSS feed (here is where I’m supposed to link to [Phil Ringnalda](http://www.philringnalda.com) and [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net) saying exactly this, but I can’t find their comments offhand).

Anyway, all this makes my new [RSS feed](http://cherraa1.miniserver.com/~dmouse/rssify.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpipthepixie.tripod.com%2Findex.html), which astonishingly, even [validates](http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http://cherraa1.miniserver.com/~dmouse/rssify.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpipthepixie.tripod.com%2Findex.html)

All would be perfect if it didn’t seem to insert random exclamation marks and break the anchor link on occassion, replacing it with a link I’ve made in the text. But I can live with this, at least temporarily.

sorted.
