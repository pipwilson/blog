I don’t have an MT weblog (‘cause I’m “powered by Blogger”), but even I understand the principles behind trackback.

It seems that [Dave’s been having trouble](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/09#trackbackContinues), but I don’t see what there is to get (although admittedly, this is after I read [a very good explanation](http://www.hitormiss.org/projects/trackback/)), I have a short html form for when I want to send a trackback from my Blogger blog, which takes the TB URL (which is the trackback:ping=”xx” bit of the embedded RDF snippet), then enter my entry title and an excerpt and hit submit. It takes about a minute, which is probably about 59 seconds longer than a native MT user, but it works.

Dave may also like to know that both [Sam Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net) and [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org) have the embedded RDF in their weblog posts, uncommented and commented respectively, I suspect the commented version is more correct, but I could easily be wrong.
