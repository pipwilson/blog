Fairly surprisingly, [Danny Ayers’ post](http://dannyayers.com/archives/001223.html) about the [FOAF autocreation from OPML file](http://www.tecknik.net/autofoaf/) tool made the top 15 of [Daypop](http://www.daypop.com/top). Surprising, but nice. [As noted before](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_04_01_blog.html#91840939), FOAF is a really good thing, not least because it demonstrates a fairly simple use of RDF, but also because it has the potential for wider practical applications, especially now that the new version of Movable Type ([TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/)) will automatically provide its users with a FOAF file.

For the rest of us, I think I’d like to see the [FOAF-a-matic 2](http://www.ldodds.com/wordtin/Wiki.jsp?page=FOAFaMaticMark2) be finished (or at least, have functionality provided for the pages that are there) – maybe I should ask if I can lend a hand.

Will FOAF be the embodiment of “Social Software”? Who knows, but at least it lets me use a buzzphrase.
