I give up. I give in. I concede defeat. Regular expressions have been for a long time been my weakest field, and my attempts to make a Java version of [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/index.html) have ended in ignominy.

Has anyone already performed this regex-a-plenty task? Or is anyone else willing to give it a go? Go on [Lazyweb](http://www.lazyweb.org), be my hero.

(Mark Pilgrim also wrote a version in Python, which you can see [here](http://diveintomark.org/projects/pytextile/))
