[JTextile](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/code/jtextile.html "JTextile") 1.0 is now out. Thanks to Gareth Simpson for his hard work whilst I was out sunning myself.

There are a few bugs to be cleared, but if there are any I havenâ€™t spotted, just leave a comment.

Fixed some bugs, introduced a new rule, as proposed by Scott in the comments.
