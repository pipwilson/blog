More importantly than anything else at the moment though (*translate: bugging me the most*) is that Blogger doesn’t generate RSS feeds.

Blogger Pro users seem to be able to do this, but with the widespread proliferation of free and simple blogging tools which all provide this, this is something Blogger really needs to sort out.

Suffice to say that as soon as I have a [Joggle](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joggle "Jabber-based blogging") server set up, this site will be available in RSS 0.91 and 2.0.

And about bloody time.

I think I’ve discovered my [favourite diveintomark post ever](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/22/debate.html "about Dave Winer"). And who said programmers couldn’t be funny?
