Like the Mozilla DOM Inspector?

Linked from the [wdf-dom mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wdf-dom/messages) you download and install a very good DOM viewer for IE from <http://www.cheztabor.com/IEDocMon/> and if youâ€™re not already using the appropriate [webdev bookmarklets](http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html) (if not, why not?), you can grab [Source Tree](http://www.cheztabor.com/SourceTree/index.htm) which will show you the CSS and JS of a page, and all these from an explorer bar!

Excellent stuff!
