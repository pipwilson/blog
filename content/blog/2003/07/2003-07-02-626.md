### RSS Bru-ha-ha

When I originally created [my RSS feed](http://jabbernet.org/rssify.php), it was version 0.91. I’d read [the spec](http://backend.userland.com/rss091), seen [the example feed](http://static.userland.com/gems/backend/sampleRss.xml), and based my own feed on these.

Then I “upgraded” it to 2.0. I started to read the spec, but I was short on time and patience. So I looked at other 2.0 feeds to see how I should create my own, notably [Sam Ruby’s](http://intertwingly.net/blog/index.rss2) and [Mark Pilgrim’s](http://diveintomark.org/xml/rss.xml)

This is the typical “view-source” approach that most people took when they were learning HTML.

But I did it wrong. I did it like I thought it should be, like I thought it would be used by others, not how it’s supposed to be.

Mark had done the same. So [he’s changed his feed](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/01/leave_rss_alone.html). His very, *very* popular feed, and made it how the RSS spec author intended it to be.

A lot of people think he’s taking the piss, showing how “useless” RSS is, and why everyone should get behind the [Necho](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage) project. I don’t think he is. I think we all took RSS as something more than it was intended to be.

> This is not a stunt, and itâ??s not a satire, and youâ??re not going to wake up tomorrow and visit diveintomark.org and see a post that says “ha ha, just kidding“. This is an honest attempt to “do RSS right“, according to the spec and the intention of the spec author \[…\]

Think of it as the RSS Standards Campaign.

(I, incidentally, couldn’t give two hoots for what my feed’s supposed to be, and shall probably move to [RSS 3.0](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rss30) any day now 😉 )

p.s. I was hoping to be able to send trackback pings to a number of weblogs critisicing Mark for this change, but I can’t, because they all use Radio. The cynic in me arches an eyebrow at this.
