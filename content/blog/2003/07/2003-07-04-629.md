Today, the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk) have an article about how [the north-south divide in the UK is getting worse](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3043370.stm)

Articles like these, focussing on what the government could, should and is doing really donâ€™t highlight the drastic difference there is between actually *living* in the south, and in the north.

To put things in perspective, I lived for 18 years in Bristol<sup>\[[1](#bristol)\]</sup> ([location](http://multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?X=400000&Y=0&width=500&height=300&client=public&gride=362983&gridn=174049&keepicon=true&coordsys=gb&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=BS57SH&advanced=&up.x=21&up.y=0&scale=4000000)), then for four years in Reading<sup>\[[2](#reading)\]</sup> ([location](http://multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?X=400000&Y=200000&width=500&height=300&client=public&gride=473913&gridn=172173&keepicon=true&coordsys=gb&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=RG66BQ&advanced=&out.x=14&out.y=12&scale=2000000)). Both are very affluent, modern, have great shopping and nightlife.

Iâ€™ve been living in Sheffield<sup>\[[3](#sheffield)\]</sup> ([location](http://multimap.co.uk/map/browse.cgi?X=400000&Y=200000&width=500&height=300&client=public&gride=435614&gridn=386646&keepicon=true&coordsys=gb&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=&advanced=&up.x=21&up.y=10&scale=4000000)) for two years now. And the difference still amazes me. Itâ€™s cold and miserable (yes, even the UK has degrees of cold and miserable). Itâ€™s painfully obvious that itâ€™s a much poorer city (I live in the media quarter, almost next-door to BBC Sheffield, and even thatâ€™s still grotty); itâ€™s dirtier, more rubbish-strewn, the people are less friendly, and so on.

Sheffield is one of the largest cities in the UK (the [5th most populous](http://www.uknow.or.jp/uknow_e/about/facts/01.htm)), but also [one of the fattest](http://www.muscle-fitness-europe.com/324.html) .

[Sheffield centre looking its best](http://www.apcr39.dsl.pipex.com/pictures/digital%20pictures/oct01/sheff_towncenter30oct01.jpg) and [Bristol looking a bit better](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/cityviews/citycentre/12.shtml).

Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s an intelligent point to be made in here somewhere, possibly with reference to the seven new heads of regional investment (London gets a region all to itself) who are going to be the ones specifying where the government should be doling out its cash; or even about the complete under-investment in anywhere north of the Watford Gap, London-centric population and job booms, airport focus etc. etc.

Sadly, itâ€™s Friday afternoon, Iâ€™m tired and ill, and applications donâ€™t write themselves.
