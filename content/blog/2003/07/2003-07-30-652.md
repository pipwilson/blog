I hate crashes in the middle of blog posts. But anyway..

[JabRSS](http://cmeerw.org/dev/node/view/7) has been playing up all today, so I only got the news via the old-school method of visiting [Danny](http://dannyayers.com)’s site, but [Peter Saint-Andre](http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/) (aka King of [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org)) has posted on the [rdfweb-dev mailing list](http://rdfweb.org/mailman/listinfo/rdfweb-dev) that they’re thinking about using [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/) to identify Jabber entities. Currently Jabber uses vCard to identify users, and a hacked [vCard-temp](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0054.html) namespace to identify Jabber Components (IIRC); the use of FOAF would be a great, great move. These are currently the two technologies I’m most interested in, so perhaps I’m biased, but I can’t see of anything but good coming from this.

On a more downbeat note, I can’t quite get my head around what the simplest way of linking a Jabber account with a pre-exisiting FOAF file could be, except for some kind of [smushing](http://rdfweb.org/topic/Smushing) based on the jabberID property.

Interestingly, Peter points out that <q cite="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2003-07.html#2003-07-25T21:40">It \[FOAF\] defines data elements for things like projectHomepage and geek code, but not for things like marital status or sex</q>. This hadn’t even occured to me before. The file says who I am, who I know, where I went to school and what my interests are, but not if I’m a boy or a girl. Is this an oversight, or defined elsewhere? I’ve not seen it in the [relationship vocab](http://www.perceive.net/schemas/20020729/relationship/) or [biographical vocab](http://internetalchemy.org/vocab/bio/0.1/), which seemed the only likely candidates.
