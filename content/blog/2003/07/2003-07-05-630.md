Some interesting stuff:

[Writing FOAF in XML](http://simonstl.com/projects/foaf-xml/) – I know RDF is supposed to be a machine language, but the majority of [my FOAF file](http://philwilson.org/philfoaf.rdf) is hand-rolled, and I suspect most other peoples’ are too. Being able to write it straight off in XML would certainly cut down writing time, as well as lowering the barrier to entry and hand-editing, and since it’s just run through an XSLT, could be turned into a web service.

[IE in SWT](http://www.freeroller.net/page/umlauf/20030703#ie_on_swt) – this is good. I’ve been looking for a way to have an embedded browser in a cross-platform application, and can’t decide between SWT and wx4j (Swing is just far too clunky a UI). This makes me lean towards SWT.

[AOL will blog](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_07.html#004146) – interesting news about how AOL-ers will be able to blog from their IM, and shows that AOL are actually aware of the blogging world and such tools as Technorati.

Of course, I’ve been able to blog from Jabber for weeks and weeks now, run through JTextile to make for easier formatting. I must release that to the general public soon (it’s a jabber server component).
