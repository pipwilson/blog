via [Danny](http://dannyayers.com/archives/001586.html) comes a link to an article which in turn links to the [Getty Thesuarus of Geographic Names](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/). Sounds a bit tedious, but fortunately for all those who want to add accurate [GeoURL](http://www.geourl.org) data to their webpages and don’t have GPS systems available to them, this site could be the answer.

Type in your city and country, or use the popups to select where you mean, and get the co-ordinates back! Easy Peasy.

(Of course, for those in the UK, we can always use the more accurate [MultiMap](http://www.multimap.com), which shows the co-ordinates under “Map Information”, although I’m not sure it always did so)
