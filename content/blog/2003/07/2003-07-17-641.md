It’s about time the information about FOAF was pulled together. There’s quite a bit of it, but it’s spread over the web, with no guarantee of everything pointing to everything else. Gathering it all together on a website (not a wiki, and the [foaflog](http://rdfweb.org/) is slightly too developer-centric) is something that really needs to be tackled (as [Marc Canter](http://blogs.it/0100198/) has been calling for on the rdfweb-dev mailing list). Fortunately someone’s made a go at doing just that:

[Example FOAF website](http://www.apocalypse.org/~nicole/FOAF/foaf-website2/index.html)

It links to the specs, the tools, the foaflog, pulls together articles posted on disparate weblogs all to make one big excellent FOAF resource. The design is *slightly* too garish and the text line-spacing *slightly* too tight for me, but I can live with this. A few contributed “beginners” articles and this would be excellent.

Keeping to the web theme, [mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org) has a new site, designed to be more appealing to end users instead of developers. It’s OK, but will be a *hell* of a lot better once the “What Is The Mozilla Foundation?” box has gone. Also, it’s particularly strange that the website of one of the most standards-compliant browsers was designed with tables, luckily [Tom Gilder](http://blog.tom.me.uk/) comes to the rescue with a version of the site [just in CSS](http://tom.me.uk/mocks/mozilla/) – mozilla.org take note! (side note: Tom also has a really nice line in “CSS3 quickies”, like [wavy underlining](http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/07/17/looking_ahead_to_css3_part_2_funky_underlines.php) and the [::outside element](http://blog.tom.me.uk/2003/07/14/looking_ahead_to_css3_part_1_the_outside_pseudoelement.php). For those who can’t be bothered to trudge through the CSS3 draft (although if you like this kind of thing, and I do, it’s very interesting), this is great stuff.
