In yesterday’s ramble about Netscape, [I suggested](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_07_13_blog.html#105835997396297145) that a Mozilla browser needed to be branded to make any decent headway onto home users’ desktops.

[Anil Dash](http://www.dashes.com/anil) has floated the idea that this branding should be [done by Google](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/006726.php), and [Simon Willison has also posted about it](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/07/17/theGoogleBrowser).

I really think this would be an excellent move. Obviously the main stumbling block would be the business model to base this around, but as Anil suggests, built-in hooks to Google services and ads could do this.

But would people use “The Google Browser”? What on earth would it be marketed as? Googlezilla? What a mouthful!
