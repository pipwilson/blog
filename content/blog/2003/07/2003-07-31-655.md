At work I’ve been asked to write a (very small) SWT app, being the only member of the development team with any Java GUI experience at all (I’ve written some Swing apps before).

Of course, there are hundreds of SWT resources out there on the web, notably [on dev.eclipse.org](http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-swt-home/dev.html) web site and the [eclipse wiki](http://eclipsewiki.swiki.net/1), but by far the best I found were [notes written for Computer Science students](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~eclipse/) (in pdf) – if only my lecturers had been able to make things this clear, simple and understandable!

It’s interesting to note that [Eugene Belyaev](http://www.eugenebelyaev.com) has also started to [look at SWT](http://www.eugenebelyaev.com/begblog/java/000039.html), and in whose comments, someone has also posted a link to the resources I mention above.

Serendipity is clearly afoot though, because his previous weblog entry is about how to [  
Launch the default browser on Windows](http://www.eugenebelyaev.com/begblog//000037.html) with this bit of code:

`<br></br>String url = "http://www.eugenebelyaev.com";<br></br>Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler " + url);<br></br>`

which I was also looking for!
