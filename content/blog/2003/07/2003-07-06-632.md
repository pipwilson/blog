I’m a very argumentative person. I like arguing; and not only do I like it, I’m always right. Also, I’m much better than you. This isn’t just vanity, it’s a fact. I’m faster, cleverer and braver. I’m stronger, more attractive and more versatile. If there’s an area I appear to not know anything about, it’s because I’ve never had the need to look into it, but I’m sure that if I did, I’d be much better at it than you anyway.

Of course, arguments on the web are hard to follow. They’re spread across websites, mailing lists, wikis, comments in articles. A thousand flowers may bloom may normally be a good principle, but it makes a bastard of finding them all.

At this point, with frustration looming (“who is right?”, “did he *really* say that about him?”, “where did he gets his facts from?”), all is solved by [The Pixie Test](http://www.submitresponse.co.uk/archives/echo_rss_and_pixies.php)

This reduces any argument to one simple question: “Who’s a lovely little pixie?” (see the above link for some good examples of this in practice).

Fortunately for me, my age-old nickname “Pip” (and the origin of my Tripod account name) stems from [Enid Blyton’s stories of Pip the Pixie](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cache:9woFfdUK3M4J:www.usedbookcentral.com/texis/ubc/searchbooks,sid,10253,jump,200.html+the+adventures+of+pip+blyton&hl=en&ie=UTF-8) (amusingly enough, listed just below “Operation Homicide”), so serendipity has spoken, and, with the combination of my assumed moniker, high cheekbones and delicate nose I automatically win all arguments. Huzzah!
