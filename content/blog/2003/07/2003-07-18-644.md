I know how involved [Edd Dumbill](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog) is in the [FOAF](http://rdfweb.org/) community, but I’d never taken the time out to read [the FOAF section of his website](http://usefulinc.com/foaf).

I’m glad I finally did; his three tutorials: [Adding people into the FOAF web](http://usefulinc.com/foaf/addingPeople), [Digitally signing FOAF files](http://usefulinc.com/foaf/signingFoafFiles) and [Limiting who can read a FOAF file](http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles) are excellent beginners tutorials, just like I was after [yesterday](http://pipthepixie.tripod.com/blog/archive/2003_07_01_blog.html#105845619879555796).
