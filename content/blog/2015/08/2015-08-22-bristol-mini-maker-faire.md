Today I took my 6 and 2 year olds into town to look around the [Bristol Mini Maker Faire](http://bristolmakerfaire.com/). It was really good and highly recommended.

We saw the Nao and Baxter robots from [Active8 Robotics](http://www.active8robots.com/), a laser cutter from [Just Add Sharks](http://justaddsharks.co.uk/) in action making press-out catapults, Raspberry Pi-powered wheel and track robots from [Dawn Robotics](http://www.dawnrobotics.co.uk/) and plenty of other things.

The kids were particularly taken by a couple who reverse-engineered childrensâ€™ electronic toys like the Furby or basic motor-controlled toys and had them rigged up to simple push buttons to make them work.

We also liked seeing how [Is Martin Running?](https://twitter.com/ismartinrunning) works, and playing on the [Makey Make](http://www.makeymakey.com/).

They were sadly a bit too young to make their own [shonkbot](http://jarkman.co.uk/catalog/robots/shonkbot.htm) or get a [Petduino](http://circuitbeard.co.uk/blog/introducing-petduino) (needs soldering) but watching the [RepRapPro](https://reprappro.com/) in action was a novelty, and we came away with some printed robot figurines which they treasured!

Many thanks to the chap from [Ragworm](http://www.ragworm.eu/) who valiantly tried to explain how circuit boards are printed to my 6 year old ðŸ™‚ it will no doubt be easier to comprehend when our [Flotilla kit](http://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/flotilla) arrives!

There was lots of other homebrew displays from people who used the Bristol Hackspace and Iâ€™m only sorry I canâ€™t remember the names of their projects, but we all enjoyed it thoroughly!

Hereâ€™s looking forward to the next one!
