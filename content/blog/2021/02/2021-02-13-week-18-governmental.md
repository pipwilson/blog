- For most of the last year I’ve been working with the UK’s [Government Digital Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Digital_Service) on the COVID-19 response, specifically [the bit that helps people who have to shield get additional support](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-shielding-support). It’s been a treat to see how quickly and effectively a disparate group of civil servants came together into a brand new team, hammered out a working solution and then iterated on it again and again to improve the service, and made it flexible enough to be able to respond to frequently changing policies. Many thanks to [Tom Natt](https://www.tomnatt.com/) for getting me involved.
- I am very bad at [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)), but it’s a great game and even if I’m not *enjoying* dying repeatedly, I enjoy the bits immediately before and after.
- I am trying to move house. It is not going well. On Monday I will find out if we need to start all over again. Not overjoyed.
