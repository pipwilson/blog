These are the birds I regularly see in my garden:

- blackbirds
- goldfinches
- pigeons
- collared doves
- sparrows
- robins
- blue tits
- great tits

Very very occassionally we get a jay and a greenfinch. This all feels quite varied until you read the RSPB list of common garden birds:

> The most likely visitors to your garden are starlings, house sparrows, blackbirds, blue and great tits, robins, greenfinches and collared doves.

Humph.
