I moved house. That’s it, that’s the update.

The good thing is that I now have [a fiber-to-the-premises internet connection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x), which means it is nice and fast, and wasn’t an option at my last house. It does mean I had to hand back my TiVo box (because we can’t get Virgin Media), so I am PVR-less for the first time in a couple of decades, but with the rise in streaming services maybe I don’t need it any more? Time will tell for sure, but the options on the market all look a bit crap (presumably because those streaming services have eaten their market).

The bad news is being surrounded by cardboard boxes all the time in every room. Seriously. You’d think there’d be a good opportunity to build a box fort, but if it collapses there’s a real danger of being hit in the head by a misfiled frying pan, Tex Avery style.

Hopefully after a bit more unpacking I can get back to hacking on some code again. That would be nice.
