Whatever else was going on this week was completely overshadowed by having to rush my daughter to hospital at 1am in an ambulance because she was having trouble breathing and her blood oxygen levels were dropping quickly.

Three days later and we were back home.

It was a stressful experience, and one I do not recommend. The facilities of the Children’s Hostpital which we were in were surprisingly good; we were in a private room rather than a ward, with a bed so that a visitor was able to stay each night – these [beds were funded by the Wallace and Gromit Grand Appeal](https://www.grandappeal.org.uk/latest-news/new-parent-beds-funded-for-bristol-childrens-hospital/). The doctor and nurses were friendly and efficient – all very reassuring should we ever need to make another unwelcome visit.
