After finishing a year-long stint working for the Government Digital Service to [deliver support to people during the worst of the pandemic](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/24/podcast-the-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-people-service/), I took a month off.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium">[![](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/svps-300x300.jpg)](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/svps.jpg)<figcaption>A GDS Mission Patch of my very own</figcaption></figure>This meant that I didnâ€™t turn on a computer for most of that time, and certainly didnâ€™t feel inclined to blog. A month ago I started working at [Kaluza](https://www.kaluza.com/) (lured in by [Ovoâ€™s Plan Zero](https://ovo.com/planzero/about-our-plan/) approach to the climate crisis), and having just about got my head around what I need to do there, I have brain space to write words again.

With three jobs in three years, Iâ€™ve come to realise how much harder it is to reflect on my year-on-year personal development without an explicit checkpoint with a consistent third-party. Not only that, but I donâ€™t do what I tell the people I manage to do and keep a weekly log of successes or problems Iâ€™ve overcome. This makes it much harder to keep a good perspective over time on how I think Iâ€™m doing, and how I develop in a role at a new company.

Making sure I do keep a record of achievements each week is something Iâ€™ll have to do pretty much immediately, probably through setting aside some time each Friday morning to ask myself the scrum standup questions at a slightly more abstract level. This should also help keep me honest when prioritising my daily work as well. Iâ€™ll probably use the [Inkdrop Note Templates](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/inkdrop-note-templates) plugin to set up a standard way of doing this. Wish me luck ðŸ™‚
