- When I was about 5 I got my first ever “album”, which I saved up for by collecting tokens from boxes of Weetabix. I am delighted to see [it is listed on discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Weetabix-Top-Trax-Dunks-Cassette-/release/2451833). I listened to it endlessly and it shaped my musical tastes for the rest of my life.
- I had to take a lot of time off work to look after the kids this week, so my 7 year old and I watched the 1949 version of [Samson and Delilah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_(1949_film)) starring [Victor Mature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Mature) and [Hedy Lamarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr). It was great.
- We finally took down our Christmas tree, but kept the small ones in the kids bedrooms since they asked to keep them up “for morale”. Sounds good to me.
- I am playing [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)) [on my Switch](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Hades-1821819.html). It is actually annoyingly good.
- Lots of back pain after overdoing at the weekend. Nurofen and laziness are my friend.
- I am finally realising that my family having competing resource needs which need timetabling, so a webpage which displays what’s going on now and next for each person would be really helpful. Since everyone has a regular schedule most of this will just be static HTML and I’ll use some PHP to just include the right pages on the right days.
- Despite its popularity, the web interface of Google Classroom is far (FAR) from the best thing I’ve ever seen, and very easy to get lost in, so a simplified view would be great, but as usual for Google projects, the API docs and processes seem arcane and unnecessarily convoluted in order to get a very simple project up and running – there are samples, but the model of the API rarely matches the model of interacting with the service, and trying to use it ends up being a frustrating experience.
- Never mind, we are having PIZZA and then a PARTY this weekend!
