- I turned 41. This is the test subject number assigned to Tetsuo in [Akira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)).
- Building Lego is very therapeutic. This week I built Darth Vader’s TIE Advanced [from the (now retired) set which also came with an A-Wing](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/vader-s-tie-advanced-vs-a-wing-starfighter-75150) (and which I built when I first got the set a few years back).
- Continuing the Star Wars theme I got a new [X-Wing/TIE fighter hoodie](https://www.teepublic.com/en-gb/hoodie/1432614-may-25th-1977), which makes me happy.
- “These dickheads are trying for the stars! The rest of us therefore need to make sure they don’t get there first.” – from [The Regrettable Decline of Space Utopias](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/the-regrettable-decline-of-space-utopias)
- Trying to balance home schooling two children whilst also maintaining jobs is hard.
- My new [Hobonichi Techo journal](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/) arrived! I did panic a bit when 1 January rolled around and I hadn’t ordered a new one; it pretty much runs my work life, and there’s something incredibly nice about its design and manufacture which make it just lovely to use. I’m not a journaller who draws pictures and sticks in stuff from their life, but as far as todo lists goes, it’s my fave.
- I find I always publish my weeknotes “late” because I just resent going on my laptop at the weekend now, even though I use a different laptop for work in the week. Tiresome.
