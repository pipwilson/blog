Welcome to space year 2021! A bumper issue this week because I missed last week due to \*gestures all around\* all this.

- Our favourite Christmas presents were an [Entry Grade Gundam](https://www.gundammad.co.uk/product.php?productid=19446&page=1), a plush narwhal and a burrito blanket.
- We watched the [despecialised version of the original Star Wars trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition) and enjoyed it a huge amount. I don’t think we’ll bother with the pre and sequels.
- On Christmas day the kids read out a story they’d written for us, which was pretty adorable.
- I heinously pulled a muscle in my back, leading to rather less engagement with the Christmas season than normal, and leading to much screaming in the middle of the night.
- It has pretended to snow several times, but not actually done it – disappointing!
- My son now has a skateboard; maybe wet and icy weather isn’t the ideal time to learn to skateboard?
- Three of the 4 people in my house go to school every day, and now that schools are closed to all but vulnerable children, we have 3 people at home on near-constant video calls. Which makes me suddenly very glad of that Powerline purchase.
- The Christmas break was very welcome, and I could happily have many many weeks a year not working.
- Johanna Rothman has finished her [Modern Management Made Easy book trilogy](https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy/) – for me these are an easy day one purchase, since I’ve read [some of her other books](https://leanpub.com/u/johannarothman) and they’ve been brilliant. Johanna also regularly talks at events (although mostly on American timezones) and will be on [the panel of the “Future of Agile” hosted by The Future of Work Scotland on 3 Feb 2021](https://www.meetup.com/the-future-of-work-in-Scotland/events/273929043/).
