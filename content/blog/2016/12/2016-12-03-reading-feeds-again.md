When [Google Reader went away](https://www.google.com/reader/about/) I raged and sulked and tried half a dozen services touted as replacements, but eventually I installed [FeedDemon](http://feeddemon.com/) on the computer I used the most often and read my feeds daily, there.

A few weeks ago I found the [Newsfold app feed reader for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mvilla.android.quote), logged back in to my Feedly account and imported the OPML from FeedDemon.

Since then I have been happily checking my feeds every day on my phone, more or less like I used to with the Google Reader mobile app. I only have a dozen or so going at the moment, but hopefully this will slowly step up and I will actually know whatâ€™s going on the world again without having to suffer Twitter.
