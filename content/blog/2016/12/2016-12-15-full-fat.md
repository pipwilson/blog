8 years ago [The Guardian proudly announced](https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2008/oct/22/full-fat-rss-feed-upgrade) that they were providing full-text feeds of, well, everything:

> Today guardian.co.uk rolled out a major upgrade to the RSS feeds. Our feeds now contain the full content of each article so that you can take guardian.co.uk with you wherever you prefer to get your news.

Fast-forward back to today and not only do they not provide the full content of articles in their feeds (those clickthroughs and ad impressions being all-important), but not even [their developer blog](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog) has been spared. This is pretty disappointing.

My first thought was to run it through the nice [full-text RSS feed creator at fivefilters.org](http://fivefilters.org/content-only/) but it looks like [The Guardian have asked them to not allow this](http://ftr.fivefilters.org/makefulltextfeed.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fdeveloper-blog%2Frss&max=3) for their domain (damn those ads!). Luckily there are still tools out there which will convert their truncated feed into full text for me, so I was saved from having to write the relevant dozen lines of code myself, although maybe that was the point, eh developer blog?
