Weigh myself every day. Nothing about losing weight, just about recording it.

That was one of my New Year’s resolutions. Let’s see how it’s going:

![A chart of my weight on each of the days in January 2017](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-january-2017.png)

I missed four days out of a possible 31, which means I had an 87% success rate, which I think is pretty good going for a New Year’s resolution 🙂

I am simply recording my weight on a normal set of bathroom scales at roughly the same time each day and immediately adding the data to the Withings app on my phone, which I already had because I have a [Withings Activité](http://www.withings.com/uk/en/products/activite). I am a pretty steady 69kg, with small peaks after each weekend.

Whether this brings about any change in diet or exercise is yet to be seen. In the meantime, I’m just going to keep recording the data.
