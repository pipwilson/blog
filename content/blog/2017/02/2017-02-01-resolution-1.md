Weigh myself every day. Nothing about losing weight, just about recording it.

That was one of my New Yearâ€™s resolutions. Letâ€™s see how itâ€™s going:

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1462" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1462" style="width: 494px">![A chart of my weight on each of the days in January 2017](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-january-2017.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1462">My weight in January 2017</figcaption></figure>

I missed four days out of a possible 31, which means I had an 87% success rate, which I think is pretty good going for a New Yearâ€™s resolution ðŸ™‚

I am simply recording my weight on a normal set of bathroom scales at roughly the same time each day and immediately adding the data to the Withings app on my phone, which I already had because I have a [Withings ActivitÃ©](http://www.withings.com/uk/en/products/activite). I am a pretty steady 69kg, with small peaks after each weekend.

Whether this brings about any change in diet or exercise is yet to be seen. In the meantime, Iâ€™m just going to keep recording the data.
