My son is 2.5 years old. Two of his favourite TV programmes are [Timmy Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmy_Time) and [Octonauts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Octonauts) . There are 78 episodes of Timmy Time and 52 episodes of Octonauts.

There is one DVD of Octonauts, which contains eight episodes. Another DVD is due next month containing another eight episodes. This will mean that 31% of this programme is available to buy.

There are [eight Timmy Time DVDs](http://www.aardstore.com/Timmy-Time/DVD/v) totalling around 65 episodes. This means that around 83% of this programme is available to buy.

To my knowledge, the BBC have aired 100% of both these series.

A very quick look on popular, er, file distribution sites reveals about 50 episodes of Octonauts (96%), and I think every episode of Timmy Time (100%).

I want to buy stuff, and it isn’t even possible; yet it is available for free if I download it illegally. It’s been, what, five years now? Have we really not moved on?
