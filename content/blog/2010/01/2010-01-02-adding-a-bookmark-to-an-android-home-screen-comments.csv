– long press on a bookmark

rima – just long press the icon and then drag and drop it to the trash icon at the bottom of the screen."

Its quite a poor UI compared to the iOS’s approach where that “bookmark” on the home screen looks and behaves like a native app whereas in HTC sense its just a shortcut to firing up the browser with the link opened."

For instance, if I’d much rather have the proper Euronews logo of a white circle on a black field on my home than a generic white star over a red field (especially when I have a dozen other icons of the same star on a red field)."

1516,2010-11-30T03:32:43+00:00,Mike,michael.s.causey@gmail.com,,comment,0,"I’m trying to essentially use the bookmark like an app. Click the icon on the homepage, and it’ll load the relevant site. It’s a little less smooth than a well-made app, but for news sites (which 90% of my bookmarks are), I’d need connectivity whether it’s a bookmark or an app, so no real advantage to an app as far as I can see.

But I’m using it on Dolphin. And the icons are either a red flag with a white star on them. or else the same flag with a very tiny inset of the proper logo (maybe 1/15th the size of the flag). Perhaps it would be different if I were using safari.

Either way, I’m slightly disappointed that my android won’t allow me to manually change the logo (or so I think?). I’m also a little annoyed that if I put the bookmarks into folders, I can’t readily rearrange them. If I want to make the 20th bookmark the third, I’d better take all my bookmarks out and put them back in (and even then, it seems to put apps before bookmarks, even if that’s not the order you prefer).

To date, this is my only gripe about my Android – that and they haven’t worked out media streaming with netflix on all devices. A mild annoyance, but still annoying enough I’m spending time trying to fix it."

First off, thanks Phil for the guide. However I thought I might update it a bit on how to add a bookmark to the home screen on Android 4.0. as the above method won’t work.

1\) Bookmark a page in your browser  
2\) Long press on the back arrow on your browser. The History and Bookmarks menu should show up.  
3\) Select “Bookmarks”  
4\) Long press on the bookmark you want to add to your home screen, and click ‘Add shortcut to Home”"
