I’ve never used H2 before and both Libby’s instructions and the H2 installer start it in server mode, so I didn’t even realise it had an embedded mode until your comment 🙂

Obviously the bit about pure ruby is just the fact that there are native ruby bindings for sqlite rather than going via jruby."

I will have a look at it and update it on userscripts.org if I can find out why it doesn’t work on Google Reader!"

I might be possible to add an event listener to pick this up, but it will probably be some time before I can get around to it I’m afraid."
