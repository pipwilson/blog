I’ve been trying out Android on the emulator (iPhone 3G user now) and liked the few articles you have here. If you ever get anything other than a Droid or have your eye on anything (like you said in a previous post “keep you on Android) it’d definitely be cool to see a post about that. I’m a Calibre user too, so I’m gonna download this book app and give it a whirl (I use Kindle/Stanza usually on iPhone).

Thanks,  
Neil"
