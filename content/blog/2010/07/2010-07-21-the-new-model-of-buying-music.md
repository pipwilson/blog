My phone runs an app that idenitifies the song that is currently playing on the radio and an app to then buy and download that song, or the album it’s from. The two are seamlessly linked.

I am probably late to this, but listening to [6music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/) whilst I have both [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/music/web/pages/android.html) and the [Amazon mp3 store](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000366513) available to me means that, wherever I am, provided there’s not too much background noise, downloading a song that’s playing is about five presses of a touchscreen away.

This is not a good thing for my bank account but a bloody brilliant thing for those record execs looking to buy a new boat.
