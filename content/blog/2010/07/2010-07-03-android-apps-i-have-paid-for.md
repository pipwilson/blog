Droidbox pro (a [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) client that came out months before the official one, and still seems better)

[Jewellust](http://smartpixgames.com/jewellust.php) (a bejeweled clone)

[BeyondPod](http://www.beyondpod.mobi/android/index.htm) (a podcatcher. I have stopped using this since I realised it was trashing filenames)

[Reddit is fun](http://github.com/talklittle/reddit-is-fun) (because the author deserved my $1)

Other than BeyondPod, I recommend these paid-for apps. BeyondPod may have fixed my bug, I haven’t checked.

The other 50 or so apps I have are free. I am very much hoping that froyo (android 2.2) comes to the motorola milestone so that I can install apps to the sd card – I keep running out of internal memory!
