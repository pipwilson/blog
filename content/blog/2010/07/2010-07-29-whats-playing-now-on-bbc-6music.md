I don’t know how to add a link to the [Amazon MP3](http://www.amazon.co.uk/MP3-Music-Download/b?ie=UTF8&node=77197031) store for a given song. If I did then I would add that to <http://philwilson.org/6music/> and its purpose of letting me easily find out what song is currently playing and then buying it, would be complete.

As it is, it is merely a useful tool to be able to tell, pulling data from [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/bbc6music) and [twitter](http://twitter.com/on_6music), what the current track being played on [6music](www.bbc.co.uk/6music/) is, and which show is playing it.

The BBC are the ones pushing the “now playing” data to last.fm but the name of the show comes from a robot built by [Nigel Crawley](http://www.nigelcrawley.co.uk/). At no point does [my code](https://github.com/pipwilson/6music) look at any of the BBC sites or services directly.

If only I could get the link to Amazon working then my sofa-based listening and purchasing experience would be complete.
