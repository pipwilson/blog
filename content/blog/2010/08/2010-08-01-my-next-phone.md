[![android-usb](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/androidusb.jpg "android-usb")](http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1090) I have a Motorola Milestone and on the whole I’ve been happy with it. There have been a few issues which affect me (all introduced by Motorola themselves) but hopefully these will get resolved with [the next software update](http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=121867580498&topic=16890), and of course I’m very much hoping that Froyo hits my device.

The camera is poor though, so when my contract is up in a year’s time, that will be a requirement.

More pressingly though, I’m finding that I have more and more portable devices that support USB (pen drives, external hard drives, cameras, mp3 players, my kindle-of-the-future), and I want my phone to act as a host for these. It is, after all, my always-on, always-with-me computer, and has all the apps I need to manage those devices and a wifi connection so I can up- or download any bits that I need.

As far as I know, none of the Android devices come with it supported natively, but people have got host mode working on both the [Nexus One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-bLOc1qnMM), [Milestone](http://www.tombom.co.uk/blog/?p=124) and [Hero](http://github.com/adq/kernel-hero/tree/usbhost) using custom kernels. The Nokia N800 and N8 seem to do it out of the box:

Increasingly, my laptop is a barrier to doing things like getting photos online. I realise I could get an [eye-fi](http://www.eye.fi/) or something similar, but that also takes away a level of flexibility and pre-upload functionality that my phone gives me.

Here’s hoping it’s a popular or common feature in a year’s time!
