Between apps to upload to facebook, twitter, wordpress, flickr, and tumblr (most of which also support email uploads with no app required) it does become a three-click process. It is the future. It is glorious."

I assume the N1 also has one of these. The editing facilities on android are pretty good, and all those apps are available here too, but I’ve clearly been spoiled by the quality of my nokia device."
