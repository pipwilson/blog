My set of ‘twitter only’ friends is, happily, dwindling."

I still hate facebook too much to switch to that though, so it pretty much looks like I’m opting out of micro-blogging altogether."

FWIW I ended up hacking the scuttle core so that scuttle is my primary bookmarking tool and posts to delicious in the background. I need to sort out my Twitter backups/secondary posting, and I have no idea what to do with Facebook. It’s where the family is and hence is a small silo of data.

I should blog more."
