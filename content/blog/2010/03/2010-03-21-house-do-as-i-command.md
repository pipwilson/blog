How hard would it be to wire up mics and speakers in every room and have them connected to an Android device (even a phone) which is permanently looking to do a voice-driven search provided there is a three second gap before the word “house” (or, y’know, [HAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000), [Gort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gort_(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still)) or whatever you like)?
