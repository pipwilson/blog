A few months ago at the [Institutional Web Manager’s Workshop](http://iwmw.ukoln.ac.uk/iwmw2010/) I helped run [a session on PRINCE2 and Scrum](http://iwmw.ukoln.ac.uk/iwmw2010/sessions/barnes/) with Peter Barnes from the University of Reading.

I was terrible.

At the start of the session we collected several common problems that people face on their projects. From memory, these included:

- missed deadlines
- incomplete specs
- feature creep
- under-resourcing
- no requirement to finish (managers don’t care about the project)

I failed to address any of these points, managing only to give a reasonably poor overview of Scrum as a whole, making both myself and Scrum look bad.

I plan on addressing the issues above in a series of blog posts tagged with “iwmw2010” which was the hashtag for the event to try and cover what I should have done at the time. Feel free to [subscribe to the feed for just that content](http://philwilson.org/blog/tag/iwmw2010/feed)!
