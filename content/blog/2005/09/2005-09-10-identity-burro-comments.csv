Flickr lets you have an HTML description, but do the others? And then presumably the script would have to download and scan multiple sources looking for the rel attributes. Hmm."

there is a possible way to embed in remote sites (i.e. flickr) a link back to your blog, or simple page where you can express with rel=”me”  
I think it can work. For people that don’t have blogs, someone could provide a site (identitiespool.org ?) in which you register and state that you are xxx@flickr, <yyy@del.icio.us>, etc. identitiespool.org could export those data both in FOAF and in XFN. just an idea …

on the other hand, peritus (who provided improuvements to the code) was interested in adding FOAF support, see comments in my post."
