I think word of mouth would help to publicise it – and you could always use the traditional noticeboard.  
Note that you’d have to watch the toc of your isp to make sure they don’t mind you doing this!"

There are about 10 flats in my building and the managing agent is terrible at getting anything done, strength in numbers etc…

Why do it over wifi though? Why not just stick a php bb on a server?"

phpbb? I may as well \*ask\* for my server to be hacked 🙂

anyway, wifi’s more fun 🙂"
