[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) is an ajax web application along the lines of [Google IG](http://www.google.com/ig) (does that thing have a real name?), except a lot slicker – it really feels responsive and like a real application, and I can *easily* imagine using it as my personal portal – something I’d use to start off with each day. Of course, I’d want to run it on my own server though, but at the moment it looks unlikely that they’d release the code to do that (personal opinion – I could be wrong!).
