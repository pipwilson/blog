Several months ago I made a post titled [“Request for ID – scam?”](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/05/request-for-id-scam.html), and then [followed-up when I discovered it wasn’t](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/06/proof-of-id-for-recruitment-agencies.html).

I’ve just had a nice phone call from the legal people at Computer People who discovered my post via a search engine and asked me very nicely to clarify on the original post that the email was actually a legitimate request. So I have, and also linked to this post.

At the same time, just as I did to their legal department, I’d like to highlight that I did actually ask for clarification at the time, and didn’t receive any. I also spent a good amount of time searching their website for more details or information about this but couldn’t find any. I had to go as far as looking to see if any other recruitment agency websites mentioned it, and then finding the DTI Conduct Regulations on a government website (remember that the original email didn’t even tell me *which* regulations I would be complying with – I had to find out myself), and then reading it until I found what the email might have been talking about (it’s a fifty-three page PDF document).

I’ve had quite a lot of phone conversations with various recruiters from Computer People in the past six months, and they’ve all been pleasant, helpful, efficient and friendly. It seems a shame that their image can be so easily damaged by a poor email (actually, I received this email twice, the first one I replied to, the second one I ignored since my reply to the first one hadn’t been answered).

So just a reminder then, to Computer People:

**Your “Request for ID” email looks like an identity theft scam. Include details of the regulations you’re supposed to be complying with. Reply to emails querying it.**

Thank you 🙂
