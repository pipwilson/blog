Yahoo! has so much sometimes it’s hard to remember it all: Search, Groups, Maps, News, Local, Personals, Stores… I think where they lack in quality they try to make uo for it in quantity.

Still, we need Yahoo! if for nothing more than to be competition to Google.

I must have joined Yahoo! back in the late-1990’s when the sign-up form was not quite as daunting…"

Yes, same here.

Interestingly, I only discovered Yahoo’s cinema listings a few weeks ago, and alf’s right, they’re very good (better with the GM script that turns addresses into links to Google maps).

I haven’t seen the TV listings, I’ll have to have a look at those.

Quantity over quality; yes, that sounds like Yahoo to me."

I think they lost their way, but like all companies in the search space, they’ve learned from Google and may well be on the way back up."
