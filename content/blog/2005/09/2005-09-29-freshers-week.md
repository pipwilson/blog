Itâ€™s Fresherâ€™s Week at the University of Bath, and the place is filled with bright and eager young things walking around whilst members of various clubs and organisations try and recruit them with ever more exciting displays; today there are jugglers, salsa dancers, rowers (plus boat), and a girl in a short skirt offering to sell you a sausage for a pound.

Itâ€™s actually kind of nice to see so many fresh and innocent faces around, not to mention the feeling that the campus is waking up again after a short snooze. Weâ€™ll have to see if this attitude continues once terms is in full swing and thereâ€™s nowhere to eat at lunchtime. ðŸ™‚
