From the comment by [Jake Tracey](http://jaketracey.com/) on [Flickr signup: From human to droid in a Yahoo moment?](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/flickr_signup_from_human_to_droid_in_a_yahoo_moment.php).

Do people still fill in massive sign-up forms like the Yahoo! one on display at the 37signals post? Jesus, why? I can’t think of a single compelling offering from Yahoo. Not only is their website ludicrously hard to navigate, but I’ve only ever met **two** people who use Yahoo Messenger. Don’t get me started on their “personal” offerings like Yahoo 360. Christ that’s terrible.

Nothing that Yahoo provides is enjoyable, and that, I think is the real kicker.
