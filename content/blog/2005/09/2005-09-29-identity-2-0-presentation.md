Do you know Dick about Identity 2.0?

Dick Hardt gave a keynote address at OSCON 2005 about whatâ€™s involved with identity 2.0 and touched on reputation and trust. Not much new, but a really nice summary and some good pointers at the end to where real progress might be driven from and by whom.

[The video of the presentation is online](http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/ "Identity 2.0 Presentation") in Flash, Quicktime and Windows Media. Worth a watch.
