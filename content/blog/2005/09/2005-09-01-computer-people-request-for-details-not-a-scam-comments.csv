It took 10 minutes for me to find the reference, it’s a shame that agencies don’t go to the same effort, but I guess this shows the general level of understanding or professionalism you can expect from the majority.

I should also point out that I did link to and quote from that PDF on [my previous post on the subject](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/06/proof-of-id-for-recruitment-agencies.html)."

Dear Christopher

Under new DTI regulations, we are now required to provide proof of identification when we propose a candidate to a client for consideration against a job vacancy.

We would appreciate it therefore if you could, by return, send us either a scanned copy by email, or a photocopy of one of the following documents:

Your passport or European ID Card, along with confirmation of your National Insurance Number

In addition, where applicable, please include a copy of your work visa.

Please send these details to:

Fax: 0207 440 3681

Email: <jade.tango@people-direct.com>

Post: People Direct, 33 Regent Street, London, SW1Y 4NB

Thanks for your assistance. We look forward to hearing from you.

 Yours sincerely ( etc)

IS this a scam, or is it all above board??

Would appreciate your comments

many thanks

Chris ( <c.ferrey@tgis.co.uk>)"

I would certainly never send these kinds of details to an address (e-mail or postal) if I wasn’t 100% certain that they were going to the right place. A whois on the domain (I used <http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/index.jsp>) showed that it people-direct.com seemingly belongs to a bulk registrar.

The address postcode in your email does match that on [http://www.people-direct.com/contact\_us.htm](http://www.people-direct.com/contact_us.htm)

So you have to ask yourself:

\* is people-direct.com the real agency?  
\* did their email come out of an application you made?  
\* is there another way of contacting them to ensure the addresses are real? Like looking them up on yell.com or the dead tree version (Yellow Pages).

and so on.

If this was the first mail you’d received from them, I’d reply asking what they wanted these details for and what job they thought I might be interested in etc.

Good luck!"

A collegue of mine spent several hours in the detention cells of a German airport because he’d forwarded his passport details to a 3rd party, those details were then passed on to an individual who then used those details to create a fake passport in order to traffic drugs throughout Europe.

Obviously we found this funny, and left pairs of latex gloves on his desk as a “reminder” of those times, but his experiance of being branded an international drug trafficer has increased my reluctance to hand over this sort of documentation.

I would be happy to give an **employer** my National Insurance number and allow them to inspect my drivers license or passport, but there must be a justifiable requirement and a documented records management policy if they want to keep a copy."
