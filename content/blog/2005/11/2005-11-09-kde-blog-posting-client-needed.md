So at the weekend I installed what I hope will become my full-time OS, [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/).

The one thing which this, and [my week with SUSE](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/10/visit-to-linux.html) has taught me is that Linux has a dearth of third-party applications. No, really.

Almost everything that I normally use on my Windows machine had equivalents pre-installed on Kubuntu. The two standouts were a blog posting tool and a Flickr posting tool.

If you want to upload a photo to Flickr from Gnome you have multiple choices: the [FlickrUploadr](http://micampe.it/things/flickruploadr); the [a script for Nautilus](http://nozell.com/blog/archives/2004/09/04/flickr-upload-for-gnomes-nautilus/), and [Glimmr](http://glimmr.sourceforge.net/). If you want to upload from KDE, you have [KFlickr](http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/), which, try as I might, I couldn’t install cleanly. It’s the only app I’ve tried to install which has had dependency problems. So, the Flickr “upload” screen it is for me. Which is lame. There are, of course, [jUploadr](http://juploadr.sourceforge.net/), a Java client but I want a native one.

More amazingly, there doesn’t seem to be a KDE tool for posting to your blog. There’s [KLuJe](http://kluje.sourceforge.net/) for LiveJournallers, but nothing more generic for posting to, say, your WordPress, TypePad or Blogger account. Some guy started [KBlogger](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=29552) just over a month ago so it’s obviously very basic and doesn’t meet my needs, but blogs started to appear five years ago, where’s the support in Kontakt or some other key KDE app? Again, there are Java clients but they’re almost uniformly terrible.

What’s a boy to do?
