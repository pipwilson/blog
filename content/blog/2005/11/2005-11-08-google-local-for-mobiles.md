So, posting to Blogger from Firefox on Kubuntu doesn’t work and leaves me with a title and erases my post content. Lesson learned.

[Google Local for mobiles](http://google.co.uk/glm) has launched. It’s currently for the US only, but [2lmc seem to have got it working](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/5191) in the UK too. Obviously the point of Google Local is to search for things that are close to you, but the main use would probably be as an A-Z.

Frankly, given that I have to pay for my 3G per MB, I have no intention of using this until I can either use bluetooth to connect to my broadband-connected PC or get a phone which has WiFi so that it won’t cost me an absolute fortune.

At the moment, when I plan on going somewhere, I use Google Maps on my PC to view the location, and mark on a couple of useful routes, then take some screenshots at different sizes and send them to my phone. The maps are clear and easy to read, and immensley useful.

I look forward to being able to use Google Local without it costing the earth.
