All the Cairo work will be in the Gecko 1.9 work (which may or may not come to be called Gecko 2.0, but will eventually form Firefox 2.0 or 3.0).

I rather like the new options pane. OK, so it’s very Mac-esque so I’m inevitably comfortable with it (as I use both MacOS and Windows on a regular basis). The thing is, as far as I’m aware, there isn’t a standard way of presenting application options on Windows. Thuss, I don’t think it really affects how ‘native’ Firefox feels. All a matter of taste though, I’m sure.

The only other major feature I can think of is that the speeded up Back/Forward code is in there, so end-users will probably find that 1.5 feels faster (on top of Gecko 1.8 being faster at rendering than 1.7 was)."

As a Windows and Linux guy, I can honestly say that when I only knew how the new options pane worked because I’d seen it on Ben Goodgers’ weblog. Otherwise I would have had no idea.

As for the faster back/forward – like I say, I’ve been on 1.5 at work for however many weeks or months it is now, and 1.0.7 at home, and I can honestly say that I hadn’t noticed the difference."

As for why it’s there, I don’t know. But I do know that the firefox guys put it there to math the look of the overall UI more."
