The output from [Person Finder](http://www.bath.ac.uk/contact), the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/)â€˜s staff and student directory is now marked up with [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hCard). For example, [check out my entry](http://www.bath.ac.uk/person/819130 "Phil Wilson on Person Finder, University of Bath"). The amount of information available to people accessing the service from within the Universityâ€™s network is far greater, and that is also all marked up appropriately. I think thatâ€™s at least 12,000 new hCards.

I realise that Iâ€™ve forgotten to define the profile on the `head`, but Iâ€™ll fix that later, and the data is still usable via the usual Greasemonkey scripts, XSLT and bookmarklets.

Consider this my 0.1 degrees Centrigade contribution to that ocean boiling ðŸ˜‰
