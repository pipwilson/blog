What I’ve seen is big, noisy hardware and games with graphics at a level of games I was playing on the PC earlier this year.

In the same year that the PSP, Nintendo DS and Micro came out (all three of which are very impressive in very different ways), the XBox 360 is a let-down.

Over the next few years I’m sure it will get better, especially as the games start to actually make use of its power (as with all consoles) and its online services, but at the moment, it’s a big fat 🙁"
