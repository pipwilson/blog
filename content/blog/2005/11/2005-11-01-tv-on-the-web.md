After [posting about the BBC putting up a show for download](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/10/bbc-to-show-tv-series-online.html) (and remembering, of course, their [ongoing iMP trials](http://www.bbc.co.uk/imp/)), [NBC will be putting up its NBC Nightly News for broadcast on the Internet](http://www.personaltechpipeline.com/news/172901997) starting on November the seventh.

I don’t have Sky, cable or Freeview, and I’ve never been to the US, so this will probably be my first real experience of American news (other than the clips of Fox News that I’ve watched in hide-eyed horror). I wait with bated breath.
