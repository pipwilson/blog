This is not 2.0 thinking and almost kind of suspicious…."

More problematic is that the structured blogging people are the same (as far as I know) as the PubSub people, and they’re about to go bust."

Also this idea that Structured Blogging and Microformats are competitors is something that is simply [not true.](http://www.kstaken.com/archives/46_microformats-and-structured-blogging-are-not-competitors.html)"
