Months and months ago there was some commotion amongst Gmail users because suddenly they could choose their “from:” address when sending mails. Excellent! This would make replying to mailing lists much easier!

Except it never appeared for me. There was supposed to be a new tab called “Accounts” on the Settings page. It wasn’t there.

Today I was reading [pinksocks.co.uk](http://pinksocks.co.uk) which I haven’t checked for ages and Hanni has a post called [Gmail Features Rollout](http://pinksocks.co.uk/2005/09/gmail-features-rollout) in which she explains that this feature is **only there if you sent your language to en-US**. Good grief! What’s wrong with having this for en-GB?

So now I’ve changed my language setting, and I now have access to this feature.

Sigh.
