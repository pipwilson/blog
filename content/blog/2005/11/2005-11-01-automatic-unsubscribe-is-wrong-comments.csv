It’s worth noting a few things about this feature:

1 – The intention behind the feature is for comments feeds or other short-term subscriptions.

2 – It’s off by default. The only way this can be turned on is by the end user.

3 – The unsubscription is based on X days of inactivity where X is determined by the user (60 days by default). If you apply this option to a regularly updated feed, you’ll basically never auto unsubscribe."

An unsubscribe event removes the feed content from FeedDemon. If you want to keep a feed’s content, but don’t want it to update any longer, you can disable updating in the feed properties."

I think that no notification is possibly acceptable if the feed just stopped updating, but if it, and the contents of items already retrieved are deleted then the user must be notified."
