Someone posted to the rdf-dev mailing list the other day, saying FOAF had had its chance to do any good, and had failed. Time to close up shop.

He missed the point. FOAF is a data format. It’s the surrounding application infrastructure which needs a kick up the arse, not the format that needs killing.

As of right now, I can’t give you one good example (off the top of my head) of an application which uses FOAF to make my life easier (or, in Jamie Zawinksky’s terms, get me laid). I can use several FOAF browsers, but frankly, whoop-de-do.

I posted a week or so ago about [spidering people you’re subscribed to](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/03/finding-related-items-in-your-rss.html), and discovering their blogrolls and so on, hence being able to find who they’re subscribed to that you’re not. Where’s the FOAF app that does this? I need to be able to generate FOAF from my reading list! ([Aaron Boodman](http://www.youngpup.net) also had something about this on his blog, but I can’t find it right now)

A little while ago I wrote [FOAFlicious](http://philwilson.org/foaflicious/), an app which generates a FOAF file from your del.icio.us inbox. What this means is that you can then spider the inboxes and find out who everyone you subscribe to is subscribed to, but you don’t – it didn’t occur to me at the time to do this, but I’m reasonable amazed no-one else has done it in the meantime.

I don’t know if I’ll have time to do that anytime soon, so please, someone, do it for me! Write all those cool FOAF apps that will show that FOAF really **is** worth it!
