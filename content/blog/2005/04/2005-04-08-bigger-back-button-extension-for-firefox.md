A little while ago I wrote some CSS that applied [Fitt’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts'_law) to [make the back button in Firefox bigger](http://www.philwilson.org/blog/2004/11/enhancing-firefox-gui-usability_29.html).

At the time, someone said I should make it an extension, and I did (based on Chu Yeow’s [“making unred tabs obvious” extension](http://blog.codefront.net/mozilla/unreadtabs/)), but forgot all about it.

It wasn’t until my Firefox installation got corrupted and I had to do a clean re-install that I realise how utterly vital it is, and I became really glad that I **had** made it an extension. Jeez – how do people cope with that insanely small back button? It’s crazy!

So, here it is: [Install Fitts’ Back Button](# "Install the Fitts' Back Button extension").
