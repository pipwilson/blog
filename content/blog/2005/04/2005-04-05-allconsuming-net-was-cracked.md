Although I’d stopped using it in the main part, I noticed the other day that [allconsuming.net](http://allconsuming.net/) was down. As [Erik Benson explains](http://erikbenson.typepad.com/mu/2005/04/my_server_has_b.html), his server was broken into and he was locked out.

One excellent outcome of this is the following information:

> I’m in the process of re-writing All Consuming so it’s really not worth the time to get it all working in its current state. I \[…\] think that this will be a good reason to get off my butt (as soon as I get back from Brazil) and finally All Consuming from its 2 year coma.

Cool stuff! If you didn’t know already, one of Erik’s recent projects was [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/) which was written in [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/), so perhaps that’s what we’ll see the rewrite of All Consuming in.

All Consuming-as-was was a great app brought low by being slightly ahead of its time, poor server performance and Erik’s likely need to do something that actually pays. Hopefully the rewrite will see it become the web goliath it deserves to be.
