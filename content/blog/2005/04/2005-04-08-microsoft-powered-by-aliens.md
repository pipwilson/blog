Dear weirdos,

Next time I’m sitting alone, in one of fifty empty chairs in a public building, waiting to be served by the helpful staff, please don’t come and sit next to me and start telling me that the reason for Microsoft’s prodigous output, and all the technological advances of the past thirty years, is because industry is doing deals with aliens.

You probably seem totally sane until you start talking, and really, I’m happy for it to stay that way. Don’t shatter my illusions, let’s leave our relationship there: both mute, but blissfully happy in our silence.

Thanks,

Phil
