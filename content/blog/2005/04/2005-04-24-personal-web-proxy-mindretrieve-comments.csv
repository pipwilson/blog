Seeing as it combines this index with IM logs, feeds and files, I think I prefer this to a proxy. It also doesn’t give the (however minimal) speed decrease of routing everything through a proxy. No cached pages though."

Certainly all of the main desktop search tools I’ve used have been complete memory hogs, and intrusive on my day-to-day computer usage. MindRetrieve has been memory-light and fast. I have indexers for the rest so I can certainly live with it until something better comes along."

As I do my usual work stuff, IT slave labor :), and a lot of personal research I’ve gotten into the habit of saving the more important articles because some sites tend to redesign and can’t find the article at all or not easily sometimes. Now I get the best of both world: can visit the page and if it’s gone go back to my cache.
