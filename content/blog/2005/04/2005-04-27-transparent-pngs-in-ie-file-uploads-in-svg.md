By now everyone has seen [Sam Fortiner’s excellent post about implementing PNG in Internet Explorer](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx), which is great news, and fulfils a long-hoped for hole in IE functionality.

More amazing is the factoid found in the comments during a discussion of whether IE should support SVG natively:

> Did you know that they have added file uploads to the latest SVG drafts? It’s utterly crazy for an image format to have features like this.

He’s not kidding either – that link really works, and really does link to the part of the SVG 1.2 Working Draft, which is a last call document. I don’t think I can really offer any insightful commentary into this; I’m too stunned.
