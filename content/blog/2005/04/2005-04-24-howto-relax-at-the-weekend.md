Whilst looking after my ill girlfriend this weekend (or rather, not; preferring to let her just get on with it), Iâ€™ve discovered the trick to have a fulfilling yet relaxing weekend: read the weekend newspapers.

Honestly; it sounds trite and prosaic but who actually does it nowadays? We spend so much of our time plugged-in and hooked-up that to take the time to sit in the lounge, sun streaming through the windows and a newspaper (or one of its many weekend supplements which are oh-so-common) on our laps is almost unheard of. Nevertheless I can inform you, first-hand, that it is a remarkably rewarding experience which I recommend to one and all.
