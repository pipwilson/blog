I’ve been slacking quite heavily on my computer games this past few weeks (read: year) which has left me with a load of games which I would have liked to complete, but haven’t:

- Super Mario Sunshine (57 shines)
- Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (c. 50% of the game)
- Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Forest Temple, c.30% of the game complete)
- Ico (10%)

Less important, but still outstanding are my GBA games:

- Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons (end of game boss)
- Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap (3rd or 4th dungeon of five, can’t remember)
- Advance Wars 2 (c. 50% of the game)
- Golden Sun 2: The Lost Age (c.40% of the game)

Of all of these I’ve listed, The Minish Cap is the one I was enjoying most, and am likely to continue with, despite it being on the GBA (fortunately I have a GBA player so can play it on my Gamecube); Ocarina of Time hasn’t really grabbed me so far, and, because I’d already completed Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, the controls feel wrong and the combat more limiting, so I don’t know how much further I’ll pursue it. Super Mario Sunshine has been a good challenge so far, and fairly enjoyable although marred by a bad camera – I’d certainly like to finish it.

In addition, I still have Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure which I got for my birthday in January but haven’t even started! With any luck I’ll find out some of my friends have got GBAs so we can play it multiplayer, the way it should be 🙂

Despite all this though, I’d still really like to pick up Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and possibly Tales of Symphonia. I think I’m a glutton for punishment 🙁
