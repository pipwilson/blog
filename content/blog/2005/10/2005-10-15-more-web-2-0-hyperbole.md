[Sphere](http://www.sphere.com) is yet another [over-hyped](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/14/first-screen-shot-of-sphere/) vapourware – sorry, stealth-mode – “Web 2.0” company.

It is <q cite="http://www.sphere.com/about.html">a blog search engine focused on discovering high quality, relevant blogs on a timely basis.</q>

Hahaha! I look forward to your search engine not finding anything that’s not in a blog! I can’t wait to sample the delights of not finding some authoratative and informative on a site not powered by Movable Type! I burn with anticipation at not being able to discover vital details in an O’Reilly article! Dear lord, I really can’t think of anything worse. Even *more* different search engines for different types of content. That’s just what we really need.

On the other hand, I look forward to them gaining lots of attention and hype from the inward-looking nerd crowd (where “echo chamber” is apparently a point completely missed) and then trying to sell their IP.

In a related aside, “Sphere” is possibly the most Web 1.0 name I’ve yet heard for a Web 2.0 company. 😉

Argh, I’ve been trying to bite my tongue because it sounds so petty but it should be “there **are** more than 18 million blogs” on the [About Sphere](http://www.sphere.com/about.html) page, not “there **is** more”.
