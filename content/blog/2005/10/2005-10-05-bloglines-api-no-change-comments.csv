It also has an API which I think already does what you are looking for (i think..). It also can synchronize with FeedDeamon and announced today, they bought NetNewsWire, so it will be soon to integrate with that. Unfortunately, to sync with FeedDeamon, you would need to pay, but I rather enjoy their online interface. I would say it’s at least worth checking out."

I must admit I’ve never tried NewsGator – I think because when I first looked at it it was an Outlook-only solution, and you had to pay for it. I’d actually completely forgotten that they even had a free web service! I’ll check it out."
