The “notorious” Marc Canter has written a piece called [Breaking the Web Wide Open!](http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=12412_0_1_0_C) in which he talks about the difficulties facing larger companies when it comes to opening access to their data, the nub being:

> Should they adopt these tools and standards, painfully cannibalizing their existing revenue for a new unproven concept, or should they stick with their currently lucrative model with the risk that eventually a bunch of upstarts eat their lunch?

He also points out where he thinks all the interesting developments will be taking place:

> **Identity  
> Attention  
> Open Media  
> Microcontent Publishing  
> Open Social Networks  
> Tags  
> Pinging   
> Routing  
> Open Communications  
> Device Management and Control**

which sounds reasonable enough. Anyway, overall the article is a nice overview of openness, where’s it been, where it is now, where it’s going and what to keep an eye on.
