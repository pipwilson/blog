Mark Nottingham does a lot of good work.

This isn’t as important, but quite fun: [Emulating W3C ,tools with mod\_rewrite](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/10/23/rewrite_tools) – a series of mod\_rewrite rules for making it more convenient to be able to validate your pages and so on. I’ve added the rules to the .htaccess for this blog, so that visiting <http://philwilson.org/blog/index.html,validate> should show you whether my blog validates or not.
