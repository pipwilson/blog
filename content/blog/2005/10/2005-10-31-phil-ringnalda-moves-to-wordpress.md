> Perl frustrations aside, I probably wouldn’t have left Movable Type if it hadn’t left me first: there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it becoming what it is, but it’s no long the software all my friends play with, it’s now the software most of my friends sell to big companies. That’s a wonderful thing, for them, but it’s really cut into the fun I have playing with it.

Moving from MT to WordPress has been an obvious web trend over the past two years, and Phil Ringnalda was the most obvious Movable Type holdout. Obviously “big companies” are where the money is, but seems like a real shame for Six Apart that they’ve effectively lost the visible, excitable, innovative blogger audience who made them in the first place.
