> I still haven’t got around to looking properly at Yahoo!s new offerings, or any of the left field things like Chris Pirillo’s new toy. There really is a lot of new stuff appearing around the blogosphere (Steve Rubel is one good source of links), and so many acquisitions – bubble city.

Bubble city is right. There’s a lot of hype, a lot of new applications, but few of them are actually a) useful or b) any good. It would be healthy for a lot of people to recover their perspective, except that of course, because it’s a bubble where everyone is making (or trying to make) money, it’s not in their interests.

This isn’t to say that there isn’t some good work going on, and that the web isn’t getting exciting again (see [native SVG](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/) and [ECMAScript 4 XML](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-357.htm) in [Firefox 1.5](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/); [the work of the WhatWG](http://www.whatwg.org/) including [the `<canvas>` tag](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Canvas_tutorial); [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/); [the Atom Publishing Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-05.txt); [IE7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/default.mspx), and so on), but there are also a lot of people churning out poor-to-average webapps and hyping themselves and others up beyond belief.

Or maybe I’m just bitter that I’m not getting some of that filthy “Web 2.0” lucre, eh?
