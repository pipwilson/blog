I must admit that although my main aggregator is FeedOnFeeds, I’m liking some of the features of Rojo."

I think Google Reader has some excellent features (the keyboard controls and the flash player for podcasts are brilliant), but the overall usability is shockingly bad, the help is poor (as far as I’ve seen it), and the entire thing feels very narrowly focussed to me. I’ve been trying to use it, but I think it’s almost certainly not aimed at technical users and given the poor usability and help, I can’t really work out *who* it *is* aimed at.

Of course, it’s just a beta at the mo, so it might get much better 🙂"

For example, I think there should be some kind of “group by feed” feature instead of throwing all the feeds together. And that sort by relevance feature I just can’t figure out! 🙂

But luckily I don’t have that many feeds, so it doesn’t bother me too much at the moment still. But *somebody* seriously needs to create a cool online feed reader! 🙂"
