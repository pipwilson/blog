I can’t really explain why I’m reading your blog when I should in fact be writing an essay on Chaucer, but there you go. It does have something to do with another more convoluted coincidence that I was investigating on lastfm though.

emma b from flickr / behemothpuss from last.fm / various other online identities that you’ll perhaps one day discover…!"

I too have noticed that using a number of the more popular websites you do occasionaly come across the same people (Emma B being a great example).

It would be good if there was a more acurate way of pulling out and highlighting interesting contacts from the interesections of interests. Taking it to it’s extreme maybe your mobile could then let you know when one of these people walks into your local pub!

Hopefully somebody will one day leverage something like FOAF to do this, here’s hoping!

You’re right of course, and hopefully these apps will start appearing."
