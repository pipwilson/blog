A few weeks ago I read this article: [IM War](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000637.html) and I’ve been meaning to blog about it ever since.

Events have overtaken me though, and yesterday [Yahoo and Microsoft announced that they will be connecting their IM networks](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Yahoo_to_Link_IM_Networks/1129075667) so that users on one system can communicate with users on the other via text and voice messages.

It seems to me that this could go two ways. Either it’s a huge lockout move designed to let the MS and Yahoo systems federate whilst locking out every other third party client, or it’s the first step towards opening up their networks. Which one do you think is more likely?

Rather unusually, [Slashdot has some good commentary](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/12/0227207&tid=215&tid=95) (so long as you’re only reading comments with a score of 4 or 5 of course).

I’ve already [sworn to never use MSN Messenger ever again](http://flickr.com/photos/pip/21254705/), so if they do indeed go for lockout, I’m going to try as hard as I possibly can to move every single one of my contacts over to Google Talk, because at least from there we have the chance of open communication.
