I’m not very good at writing about this kind of thing, but here goes anyway…

Will Wright’s new game Spore, looks set to live up to the hype that’s been surrounding it since it was first announced, but on visiting [the official website](http://spore.ea.com/), I can’t help but wish that the actual graphics were the same as the excellent Flash intro.

I love games with stylised graphics. They always seem more fun and more enjoyable than their ultra-realism-seeking counterparts (probably because the attempt always fails and it’s just painfully obvious that they’re failing, or the graphics are good but *so* jagged that it just takes away that send of realism).

Some recent examples: I loved the graphics in [The Wind Waker](http://www.zelda.com/gcn/index.jsp), [Viewtiful Joe](http://www.capcom.com/vj/) and [Alien Hominid](http://www.alienhominid.com/), and am eagerly awaiting the release of [Okami](http://www.cloverstudio.co.jp/title/okami/okami_pic01.html) (a game by the developers of Viewtiful Joe, in the style of Japanese watercolour paintings, there was [some recent coverage at E3](http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/okami/preview_6124714.html)).
