It turns out that this was a legitimate request. [Read this post for more details](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/09/computer-people-request-for-details.html).

Here’s an email I just got, allegedly from a recruitment agency

> ```
> 
> Dear Philip

Sounds like a scam to me, as I’ve been put forward by Computer People (and other agencies) for other jobs before and never had to provide this kind of detail. On the other hand, their postal address and fax number appear to check out, and they started it with “Dear Philip” whilst send the email to phil@ which suggests either a human, or a more intelligent than usual bot 🙂

Anyway, I’ve decided to call them on it and have emailed asking for a reference to the DTI regulations, as well as their company privacy policy. Although, even if it’s for real, I can’t possibly imagine sending *any* agency these details; it’s the perfect recipe for identity fraud.
