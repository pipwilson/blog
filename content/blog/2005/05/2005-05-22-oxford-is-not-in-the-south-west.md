I’m currently looking for a new job in the Bristol/Bath region of the UK, and it’s absolutely incredible how many job websites seem to think this includes Oxford, which is, *at it’s closest*, 84 miles and an hour and and a half’s drive away! You’d have thought some consideration for the M4 might come into it as well.
