From the 1st of January, this was expanded to include IT, if not all industries.

Part of my day job includes work for a recruitment consultancy – they all go on about it."

Presumably, even if it’s true, the company who hire are the ones who want my info, the recruitment agency just want it for their convenience; they don’t actually need it."
