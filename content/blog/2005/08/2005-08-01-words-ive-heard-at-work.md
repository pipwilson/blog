Iâ€™m now a couple of weeks into my job. Herewith some of the words Iâ€™ve heard people use in work-related conversation:

- RDF
- FOAF
- Microformats
- Podcasting
- RSS
- Ajax
- Blogs
- Wikis
- Social software
- Social networking
- Folksonomies
- Emergent taxonomies

An interesting set of words, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll agree. More as they arrive ðŸ™‚
