Alternatively you could just reconfigure your brain to cope with switching between languages 🙂 I find it easier to switch to German than French, though, I must admit."

I looked at <http://feeds.feedburner.com/datenbrei/> and <http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/feed/rdf/> and neither appear to use dc:language."
