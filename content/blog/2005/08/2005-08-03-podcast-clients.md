I don’t really listen to podcasts normally LUGRadio and sometimes IT Conversations, but that’s about it.

But now I need a podcast client.

I have an RSS file containing about 200 items, each with an mp3 enclosure and an empty title element (yes, I know, thanks). I want to be able to add this feed to a client and download all the items. Not 10, or 20 or select every single one and then click “update”, I just want them all.

So far no podcast software seems able to do this. A list of the ones I’ve tried so far:

- iPodder 2.1
- PodFeeder 1.1
- Nimiq
- Synclosure 0.1
- Newzie
- iPodder.NET 0.11
- Primetime Podcast Receiver
- Doppler 2.0.3
- HappyFish
- RSS Radio 1.1

(no iTunes yet – because it installs the iPod checker service, I haven’t been able to install it on this locked-down PC)

If you think one of the clients I’ve listed should be able to handle my request above, please do leave a comment.
