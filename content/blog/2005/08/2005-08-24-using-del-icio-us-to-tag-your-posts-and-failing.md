Yes, [Tom Coates](http://www.plasticbag.org) and [Ben Hammersley](http://www.benhammersley.com), I’m talking to you.

Please make your tagging useful by using rel=”tag”.

(Although I now can’t find an instance of Tom’s del.icio.us tagging except in my aggregator and Ben’s taken his site completely offline. Oh, sweet irony!)
