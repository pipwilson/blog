[Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) is finally out and is based on XMPP for text chat. This means that any normal Jabber client can also connect to Googleâ€™s servers and use it. At the moment [you canâ€™t use Google Talk to connect to the wider Jabber network](http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=23907), and I canâ€™t see that this will change any time soon. In theory you should be able to redirect which server it tries to connect to and access your normal Jabber userlist like that, although what exactly it would do with XMPP stanzas it doesnâ€™t yet support I have no idea.

The built-in VoIP chat is currently a closed protocol which they will be publishing soon. As soon as they do, I canâ€™t imagine other Jabber clients not releasing plugins to interoperate.

The client itself is clean and usable (a far, far cry from the monstrosity of MSN Messenger, which plagues your client with ads for FREE LOANS!), and ties directly into your Gmail contacts list. Itâ€™s also **very** beta. ðŸ™‚

It looks like Google are planning to use Talk to drive users to [Gmail](http://mail.google.com), and if theyâ€™re serious about it, this could mean one of the first massively scalable corporate XMPP server installations. This is a very attractive proposition, and since you can connect to it using a normal cross-protocol client, a nice way of allowing Jabber evangelists to finally point to a Jabber server which doesnâ€™t keep falling over. Obviously the Google XMPP server doesnâ€™t run any services like MSN transports itself so youâ€™re still reliant on client plugins or third-party servers for that.
