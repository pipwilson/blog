HTH…"

And you might want to watch for [Internet tv](http://www.participatoryculture.org/hype/) available from participatory culture foundation aug. 9."

All this TV over the ‘net stuff eh? It’ll never take off 😉"

It makes no difference if you have one item or 200 items, if you do not do a “catch-up” on the feed, it will download all items that it has not already downloaded."

Thanks"
