Despite the fact that [RSS 3.0 already exists](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/rss30), some guy seems have started [RSS Version 3](http://www.rss3.org/main.html).

I’m not sure if it’s a very clever joke or not. I really hope it is.

(btw. you really **have** to check out his [RSS History](http://www.rss3.org/faq.html#what_history), with free dig at RDF :))
