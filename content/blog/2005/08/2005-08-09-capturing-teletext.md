One of my daily habits is reading GameCentral (Channel 4, Teletext, pages 375-379) every day. Except that at the moment my telly reception, despite being cable, is so poor that I only actually get to read pages 375 and 376; for the rest I’m lucky if I get half a frame out of six. v.poor (Bridget Jones is back in fashion, right?).

The pages aren’t served up onto the web, so I thought I’d use a TV card, an analogue aerial and an automated task to capture the pages I wanted and serve them up as a private RSS feed so I could read them when I <strike>get to work</strike> have some spare time. Sounds good, right? So I whipped out my decade-old MM201PCTV card, stuck it in my PC, spent a couple of hours finding the right drivers, installed [DScaler](http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/), ran it, and watched my PC die horribly. It was just like running WindowsME all over again.

I don’t suppose anyone has a better idea, or instinctively (and magically) knows what I’ve done wrong? Being able to save out teletext pages would be immensely useful, and it kind of baffles me that I’ve had so much trouble trying to do it (especially now that teletext doesn’t even have a website *at all* any more).
