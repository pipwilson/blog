Iâ€™m currently subscribed to over 200 feeds, so itâ€™s really annoying when I come across [a weblog like Christoph GÃ¶rnâ€™s](http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/), which he writes in both German and English. Now, my German is good enough to be able to read most of his posts (although my vocabulary is clearly getting rusty), but it requires my brain to go through a massive context shift when Iâ€™m reading through all my posts, and probably brings me almost to a halt for a good five minutes.

Sadly for me, Christoph makes excellent posts about Jabber, Bluetooth and presence-based applications, so Iâ€™m clearly just going to have to live with it. Or find out how to get my aggregator to do automatic Google translations when Iâ€™m not looking ðŸ™‚
