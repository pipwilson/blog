When I’m online I’m mostly either at home or at work, and then I’m almost always logged in to [my Jabber server](http://www.jabbernet.org). Also, I use different resources home and work. A Jabber bot (or client plugin) which associates resources with geographical co-ordinates could be used to update a central server with your current location (maybe Norm Walsh’s [WITW](http://norman.walsh.name/2005/02/witw/is/pip) or out to an RDF or [KML](http://www.keyhole.com/kml/kml_doc.html) file). In fact, you could use the API to WITW and [Leigh Dodd’s WITW-&gt;Google maps translator](http://www.ldodds.com/projects/witw/) directly. That sounds remarkably simple. There’s even already [a command line tool to update WITW via XMPP](http://b4mad.net/datenbrei/archives/2005/04/15/witw-updater/)!
