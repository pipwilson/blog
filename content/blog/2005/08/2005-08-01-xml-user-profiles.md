> <acronym title="XML User Profiles">XUP</acronym> is an attempt to replace static per-site user accounts, which most present dynamic web sites use in absence of an easy to use and open/shared user account system. It allows people to use a single account or profile with many sites, or one of their existing user profiles on multiple other web sites.

Only just found this. Actually seems harder to understand than FOAF to me.
