I hope it helps. Sorry for the anonymous posting. I didn’t want to register with Blogger.

What the {insert explative} could the bank possibly be doing that needs IE only?

Yes, ‘View in IE’ is a possibility. I forget that it’s an extension and it’s not actually built into Firefox 🙂"

Anything more than one step is just not viable.

I’m so hard to please 🙂"

The product managers for our online banking aren’t willing to declare a browser as ‘supported’ until **everything** works perfectly. So one logoff confirmation dialog would be enough to ‘not support’ firefox.

Having said that, we don’t block access at all, more trouble than it’s worth."

Yep – I used to be an IT auditor for 2 banks (not yours), and for a while we would only support IE – because that was the only browser that had been tested to death on the system (as it was the most popular browser). We were not going to let anything go live is it was not flawless.

You should have seen the looks I got when I would complain that they didn’t support Lynx – some of us are old skool dammit!"
