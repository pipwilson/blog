Just some stream of consciousness:

The [Hula Server](http://hula-project.org/index.php/Hula_Server) [was announced](http://www.nat.org/2005/february/#15-February-2005) the other day. <q cite="http://hula-project.org/index.php/Hula_Server">Hula is a calendar and mail server.</q>

They‚Äôre planning on using [CalDAV](http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-dusseault-caldav/) as the backend for the calendaring system, which is a nice idea, but probably not realistic. I don‚Äôt think I know of any WebDAV-enabled servers I can use, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt install it on my own server. I can understand why they‚Äôd want to do it. There is no free decent alternative to Exchange etc. on Linux (I‚Äôve posted about this [a few times](http://www.google.com/search?ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=exchange+&btng=Search&domains=philwilson.org&sitesearch=philwilson.org) before).

Apparently their original idea had been a whole groupware-scale ‚Äúsolution‚Äù, but fortunately [jwz put the kybosh on that](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/444651.html) (that link is worth reading regardless ‚Äì it‚Äôs great content on how to make software that people like, and want).

I‚Äôm not really sure why a mail server needs a mail client in it really. Surely if you just make sure that Thunderbird, KMail and Evolution can use it you‚Äôre fine and don‚Äôt have to put the early effort in to make the web interface, better doing it somewhere else?

The calendar stuff is interesting. I have my own half-solution based on a hacked version of my [Tellybot](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/08/joggle-tellybot.html), but it‚Äôs not really terribly good (I have a Python script which outputs my Outlook calendar [courtesy of Aaron Johnson](http://cephas.net/blog/2004/09/17/sending_your_outlook_calendar_using_python.html) but it‚Äôs not hooked up to anything) ‚Äì it sends me reminders, but that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôm thinking about having it output .ics files and letting PHPiCalendar pick those up and display them as well as emitting RSS files. [RSSCalendar.com](http://www.rsscalendar.com) is another possibility, but doesn‚Äôt have an API, so as much as I like it (in stark contrast to my intial hating of it), I wouldn‚Äôt use it for my own stuff (I would however recommend it if my family wanted to do stuff, and then pull down the .ics files myself and put them into my own calendaring stuff).

Along with all this groupware-style stuff I clump in tools like [Dashboard](http://www.nat.org/dashboard/) so that in some interface I can type in someone‚Äôs name and have all sorts of info about them returned to me, like in this screenshot (click for bigger):

At the moment I‚Äôm doing some preliminary work on a sort of personal portal like [the kind mentioned by barb dwybad](http://www.geeked.org/archives/thoughts-on-the-digital-lifestyle-aggregator/) that includes my flickr photos, my books, my del.icio.us bookmarks, my music and my IM history (parsed from the Psi and MS Messenger history files), which is just a PHP page using Magpie (because all those things are available in RSS format) but I can‚Äôt see a reason why this could be extended to work for anyone who had those details (i.e. those URLs) specified in a FOAF file. Well, actually I can, and that‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt think of a way for machines to recognise that a URL is a link to an RSS feed of bookmarks rather than anything else, other than by detecting the ‚Äúdel.icio.us‚Äù in the URL, which is incredibly lame since I thought RDF was supposed to free us from that kind of thing.

Of course, a lot of people don‚Äôt have FOAF files, or even if they do, don‚Äôt link to all their other feeds and so on (we can‚Äôt all be [Leigh Dodds](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000129.html)), so how acceptable is it to create those files for people (whether they‚Äôre then published privately or publically)? For example: [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/) ‚Äì who has a [has a weblog](http://kottke.org/), [listens to music](http://audioscrobbler.com/user/jkottke), [takes photos](http://flickr.com/photos/jkottke), [reads books](http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://kottke.org) and so on.

So, in summary: Hula looks nice, but I don‚Äôt think it will take off; Dashboard is great, but mainly unavailable; FOAF can provide us with Dashboard-like features; calendering is hard; writing FOAF files about people is rude.

I thank you üôÇ
