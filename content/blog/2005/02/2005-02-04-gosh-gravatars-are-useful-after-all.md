Since the time I first saw them I‚Äôd thought that [Gravatars](http://www.gravatar.com/), [Favatars](http://www.peej.co.uk/thinking/2004/11/favatars.html) and FOAFatars (OK, I made that last one up but [this is what I mean](http://kasei.us/archives/2003/09/30/icons)) were cool, but useless. I appear to have just proved myself wrong.

I regularly read [Rich Rutter‚Äôs blog Clagnut](http://www.clagnut.com/), and he recently implemented Gravatars on his site. On some of his recent posts [a guy called Rob Mientjes had left some comments](http://www.clagnut.com/blog/1357/#c1579), and he‚Äôs got a Gravatar enabled which I‚Äôd noticed and thought ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs a nice-looking Gravatar‚Äù, and then forgotten all about.

Tonight I was just idly browsing Flickr, looking at all of [the photos tagged with ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/london/ "Photos tagged with London"), when I saw [a photo of the Make Poverty History rally](http://www.flickr.com/photos/planethalder/4226631/), so I clicked the link to see all of [the photos tagged with ‚Äúmake poverty history‚Äù](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/makepovertyhistory/) and saw [a photo by Neil T](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilt/3351175/) (who I happened to know was Neil Turner of [neilturner.me.uk](http://neilturner.me.uk/) fame, and reasonably local to me).

So I browsed around his photos a little, to see what was new, and came across [this one](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilt/3571938/) where one person had left a comment on that photo: Rob Mientjes. I would never have recognised the name, but his Flickr avatar is the same as his Gravatar and was instantly recognisable, so just by seeing the picture next to his comment, I knew exactly who he was, and why he was probably looking at Neil‚Äôs photos. Astonishing. Quite frankly, I‚Äôm almost more amazed that some part of my brain is actually dedicated to remembering these things üôÇ
