I can never bloody remember how to perform searches on multiple tags in Flickr: things like “photos tagged with Sheffield AND UK”. This is mainly due to the completely arcane syntax.

<http://www.flickr.com/photos/search/tags:sheffield,uk/tagmode:all/>

In fact, I more readily remembered that [2lmc had already spooled it](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/4627) than the syntax itself. Bah.
