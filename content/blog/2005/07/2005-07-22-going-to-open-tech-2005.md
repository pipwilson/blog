Iâ€™m off to [Open Tech 2005](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/) in London tomorrow (provided the trains etc. are running after the [bomb almost-blasts](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4704005.stm) yesterday), the <q cite="http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/">informal, low cost, one-day conference about technologies that anyone can have a go at</q> and which is being supported by [backstage.bbc.co.uk](<http:// backstage.bbc.co.uk>)

I rather suspect Iâ€™ll be the only geek there without a laptop ðŸ™‚ I will however have my Nintendo DS and a pad of paper. Thatâ€™s got to count for something, right?

[Check out the website](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2005/) and the page on [upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/21858).
