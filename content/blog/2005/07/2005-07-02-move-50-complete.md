So, I’m now back in Bristol, but currently at the half-way house of living with my family. Now that I’ve got a job though (at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk/)) I can start looking for somewhere proper to live.

Bath or Bristol though? Bath would be more convenient for work, but it’s also far more expensive to live in (or so my initial amateurish investigations have led me to believe), and Bristol has more going on (i.e. actual shops, cinemas).

Decisions, decisions.
