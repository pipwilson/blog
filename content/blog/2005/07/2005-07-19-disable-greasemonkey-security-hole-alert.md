[Greasemonkey has a massive security hole in it](http://mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/004022.html) which, depending on the scripts you have installed, can allow any website to read the contents of your hard drive (this is the case as far as I understand it, please leave a comment if I have the details wrong).

This is very major. In addition to being a massive explot, it also means that Mark Pilgrim’s O’Reilly book-in-the-making Greasemonkey Hacks <q cite="http://mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/004033.html">is DEAD until we fix this</q>, so here’s looking forward to a fixed version, although from what I gather it will require a large amount of work to provide a fixed yet fully-functioning GM. Good luck guys!
