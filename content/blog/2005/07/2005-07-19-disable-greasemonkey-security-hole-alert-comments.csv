5 sec. analysis: The site you’re visiting has to take action, and you have to be using greasemonkey on that page. If the site is trustworthy then it looks like you’re ok.

This means you shouldn’t run scripts for anything like “http://\*” but “http://www.google.com/\*” is probably ok.

Looking through my installed scripts I’m thinking that “http://\*.google.\*/\*” is bad. That could match “http://foo.google.malicious.com/stealyourfiles.html”

To be 100% safe, turn off greasemonkey altogether."
