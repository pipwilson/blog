Er, a bit behind the times, but never mind.

The BBC now has a prominent selector for the UK and International versions at the top of every single news page. They explain this on their help page with this marvellous piece of copy:

> You have a choice of two versions – the UK version, and the international version – with a more international feel.

There doesn’t appear to be any way to get rid of the selector, so it just sits there, forever taunting me with the fact that I don’t live in Hawaii.

If you do switch the version from UK to International, you’ll discover that for some reason the UK style guide clearly doesn’t apply, and tabs are used for navigation between the sections listed at the top of the page, and that these tabs sit on a background with a grey to black gradient. How very Web 2.0 of them.

Cheers to [blech for pointing it out](http://2lmc.org/spool/id/5232).
