It used to be the case, back in the day, where Iâ€™d highlight every big site I came across which used CSS for layout, or even validated; but there came a point where enough sites were starting to use CSS *and* validating, that I stopped.

Still, itâ€™s nice to reflect every now and again, and the new (to me, at least) [oxfamunwrapped.com](http://www.oxfamunwrapped.com/) site, where you can buy gifts and vouchers from Oxfam uses CSS for layout. It doesnâ€™t quite validate (although itâ€™s close), and the markup isnâ€™t quite semantic (`div class="vspacer"` anyone?), but itâ€™s close enough and on a big enough site to be yet another reason to have a very merry Christmas this year ðŸ™‚
