This may help:

The main problem with blogger &amp; hAtom is that blogger doesn’t provide a method for getting ISO dates."

I have something that:

\* reads your FOAF to find all RSS channels  
\* parses them all to create an ordered list of items by date  
\* plots the result on an SVG diagram, as a line with dots coloured coded by source of RSS items  
\* adds in your name and your picture for good measure

The results are sucky from a UI perspective, which is where my initial impetus ran out. Stupid me.

Cheers,

L."

As such I’m curious as to how you’re looking to expand it, and what exactly you plan to do with RSS feeds with it once you’ve done it.

Sorry this comment isn’t very eloquent, I’m hugely tired. Work’s Christmas ‘do’ – it was teetotal but the bowling has knackered me out."

Hopefully I can fix the date field in the XSLT.

Hey Leigh, that’s some good work there! I should try and finish off what I’ve got here (takes an RSS/Atom feed, finds tags, plots cumulative and separate frequency over time – good for del.icio.us, Flickr and weblogs).

Shed – I’ve already done some WikidPad integration with JSPWiki, but really I want to do non-wiki things with it, it’ll just give me a nice framework for writing GUI Python applications. I’m lazy, see 🙂"
