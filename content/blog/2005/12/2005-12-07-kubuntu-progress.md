I’ve now been running solely on Kubuntu for about two or three weeks now. Some impressions:

- it’s noticably slower than Windows, even after the update to KDE 3.5
- the Windows key is either a single key **or** a modifier, not both (so you can use it for bringing up the KDE ‘start menu’ **or** for going to the desktop (Win+D), bringing up the run prompt (Win+R), etc. – I need both!)
- Firefox 1.0.7 is *massively* slow
- Konqueror has excellent desktop integration, plus a *stunning* rendering engine, but doesn’t support bookmarklets(!), Greasemonkey (obviously), and there’s no easy way to write extensions
- keyboard navigation is *harder* than on Windows (and no, it’s not just *different* – it’s often impossible to reach key areas of KDE without using the mouse.
- the list of apps that comes with Kubuntu is impressive, and installing new apps is a breeze
- almost all of the apps which are part of the KDE core are very very good
- Kopete, on the other hand, is slightly disappointing (what’s with the giant blue heads?)
- peripheral support is great, ditto for Bluetooth
- no available blogging client: it’s Java, web-based or nothing for KDE users

In the end, the most important thing is speed. Either I’ll get more RAM (which I had been planning to do anyway), or I’ll switch back to Windows, it’s that easy. Wow, I never thought I’d reach the day when a desktop Linux was slower than Windows!
