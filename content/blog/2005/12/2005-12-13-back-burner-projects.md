In the hope that writing them down might goad me into doing some of them, here‚Äôs a list of things which keep running through my head but which I‚Äôve done little or nothing about:

- Fix my blog template so that you can navigate between posts from an individual post‚Äôs page
- Make blog archive page navigation easier
- When I post a form, intercept it with Greasemonkey ([thanks to Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/projects/greasemonkey/trapsubmit.user.js)) and save that result somewhere and serve it as RSS as a trail of what I‚Äôm doing on the web
- Write a Greasemonkey script which lets you select any element on a page and have it generate an [XOXO](http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo) file from the links inside it (i.e. create XOXO from blogrolls)
- Write a Greasemonkey script which sends someone a Flickr mail when you tag a photo with user:name (as prompted by Tom Coates and blech on plasticbag.org)
- Write that damned FOAF OnlineAccount generator using Jena. Stupid rdf:about=‚Äù‚Äù üôÅ
- Build [WikidPad](http://wikidpad.python-hosting.com/) from source and use it to implement an RSS handling tool (as prompted by [Gareth Simpson](http://xurble.org/))
- Generate an Atom file for each months‚Äô worth of blog posts and use these to generate iCal files and views like the [Sippey Timeline](http://www.sippey.com/timeline/). I‚Äôve been meaning to do this for almost two years üôÇ
- Update the [Greasemonkey Textile](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/03/textile-your-textareas-with.html) as prompted in the comments and release the new version I wrote six months ago!
- Finish writing an SVG tags over time graph-based browser ([as prompted by Leigh Dodds](http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000178.html)). Stupid maths.
