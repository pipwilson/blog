Iâ€™m moving house and job in the next few weeks (although I donâ€™t actually have a job to go to yet), and so I will need to tell lots of different people about my change in contact details. Herewith, a short list, both for my own reference and in the vain hope that someone will tell me what Iâ€™ve missed ðŸ™‚

- Bank
- Credit card company
- Mobile phone company
- Address on my CV/job websites
- Specsavers
- Electricity supplier
- Water supplier
- Telephone provider
- Internet provider
- TV Licensing people
- Council Tax people
- National Insurance
- Student Loans Agency
- Electoral Register
- Mailing lists Iâ€™m signed up to at work

Hmm, what else?
