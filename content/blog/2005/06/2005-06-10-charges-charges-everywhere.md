[Orange](http://www.orange.co.uk) charge for copies of bills older than three months.

Orange provide your last three months bills online (including complete itemisation in a PDF).

I smell a screen-scraper which generates RSS feeds with enclosures. I want to be able to access whichever of my bills I like, thank you very much.

My broadband connection is provided by [Freedom2Surf](http://www.freedom2surf.net/) (and very good they’ve been, too). Since I’m moving house in a couple of weeks, I want to cancel our contract, but because we signed the contract fewer than twelve months ago, if I cancel it now they’ll charge me £70. It’ll be cheaper for me to wait until after the move and cancel it then (I have unmetered access). That’s just insanity – what do they gain by doing this?
