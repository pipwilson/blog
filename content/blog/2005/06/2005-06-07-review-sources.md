Sites where extracting review information and generating feeds would be easy:

- [BBC Collective Reviews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/reviews)
- [Guardian Arts Reviews](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/reviews/) (actually, I’ve done this one, but don’t know where I’ve put the code 🙁 )
- [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/)

What you’d really want to do is build a list of “favourite artists” or something, and then whenever one appeared in a review feed, you’d get notified of it. So what’s the best way of building the artist list that you’d want to match against?
