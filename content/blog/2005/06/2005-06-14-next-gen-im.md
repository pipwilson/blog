Instant messengers with bluetooth detection facilities. That’s where it’s at, man.

If you’re on Linux, you’re probably a step ahead of the game already, given [this page on the Gentoo Wiki](http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Bluetooth_Proximity_Monitor) (courtesy of [Jim’s del.icio.us links](http://del.icio.us/jimh)) which shows you how to perform an action when your bluetooth phone comes into or leaves the proximity of your computer.

Psi will soon(ish) support [Ad-Hoc commands](http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0050.html) (see [the Feature Request](http://psi-im.org/flyspray/index.php?do=details&id=309) and [the examples](http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~remko/psi/rc/)), making this kind of thing all the easier. I can’t wait!

(I guess “Next-gen IM” is over-egging it a bit, but I do think it’s next-gen presence. Once Psi supports Ad-Hoc commands, I’ll be able to fulfill my dreams of [changing my Jabber status based on my calendar](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/03/changing-jabber-status-based-on-my.html) too.)
