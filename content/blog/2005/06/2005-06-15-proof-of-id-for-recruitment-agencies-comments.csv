Isn’t the Internet+Google just FAB?

You were able to alleviate my concerns"

They claim that agencies that don’t ask for this information are ‘breaking the law’. So I guess that must mean about 90% of recruitment agencies are technically breaking the law.  
They claim it is to stamp out identity fraud, illigal workers, etc.

This regulation is quite dubious.   
Anyone with photoshop skills could just post a fake passport jpg. And by sending out such confidential info as passport and national insurance ID via email would most likely be unencrypted – actually increasing the risk of Identity fraud."

You’re completely right though – the information they ask for is eminently fakeable, and compeletely worthless."

The info you provided here helps me to understand why they are asking.

I also have an additional tool to add to my “how good is this agency?” checklist. (a) Do they ask for this info, and (b), how do they reply when I ask for clarification. 🙂

Thanks again!"

The PDF linked to on the DTi website has now moved to: <http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file24248.pdf>

Interesting to note is if you are a contractor provided through a private limited company you can choose to opt-out of these regulations and that means the agency will not be required to obtain proof of ID."

Also good to see the change from a URL like <http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/agency/conduct.pdf> to a legible one like <http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file24248.pdf>

Have updated post."
