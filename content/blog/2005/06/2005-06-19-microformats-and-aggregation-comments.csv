But the review is the content. There’s no need to seperate parts of it from the others."

A review is not a single entity, it is made up of all those parts that hReview and RVW take into account. From the perspective of syndication (which is where I was coming from), the ‘content’ is the main review text.

Things like the rating, review type and so on should be stored separately, not in the same field as, the review body."
