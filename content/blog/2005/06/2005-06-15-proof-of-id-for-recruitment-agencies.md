I’ve now had contact from Computer People’s legal department about my initial post. [Read my post about it](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/09/computer-people-request-for-details.html).

Following up from my recent post where [I suspected that a request for a copy of my passport and my national insurance number was a scam](http://philwilson.org/blog/2005/05/request-for-id-scam.html):

I didn’t receive (and still haven’t) any mail back from the agency clarifying their request after I asked for it, and I couldn’t find anything at all on their website about it. However, following up [this “Is it a scam?” thread on tmdg.co.uk](http://lists.tmdg.co.uk/pipermail/sclug/2005-March/002479.html "Is it a scam?") which asks the very same question, I was lead to [this page on the Square One website](http://www.square.co.uk/pages/content.asp?PageID=145) (Square One are a UK recruitment agency) which says this:

> For candidates seeking permanent employment through Square One, the only noticeable change to the service we offer will be in relation to confirmation of identity. In order to ensure our compliance with the regulations, we will ask you to send us a copy of your driving licence, passport or birth certificate in order to verify your identity. This is required by Regulation 19 of the Conduct Regulations.

Interesting stuff indeed. Fortunately for me, they also link to the [PDF of the Conduct Regulations themselves, hosted on the DTI’s site](http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file24248.pdf), Regulation 19 of which (on page 18) says:

> **Regulation 19 Confirmation to be obtained about a work-seeker**
> 
> Provides that an employment agency or employment business must not  
> introduce or supply a work-seeker to a hirer unless it has obtained  
> confirmation:  
> (a) of the identity of the work-seeker. This will mean seeing any  
> document which provides evidence of the work-seekers identity,  
> such as his/her passport, driving licence, birth certificate.

So, at last! Clarification! How hard could it be to at least include links to this information in a request? If I sent you an email asking for a photocopy of your passport and your national insurance number, would you be perfectly happy to send it off to me? Especially if you weren’t sure of my identification (because it’s never the actual recruitment agents who talk to me who ask for this, it’s from people I’ve never heard of who happen to have domains which appear to be from the same company) ?
