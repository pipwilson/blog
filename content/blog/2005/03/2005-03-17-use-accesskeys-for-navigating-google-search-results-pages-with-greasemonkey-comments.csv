Just wanted to let you know that the first sentence in your post has a typo – it says “Alt+. and Alt+.”. (neither of them is a comma).

But nice script. I’ll add it to the wiki if it isn’t already there."

Thanks also for adding it to the wiki already! Fast moving!"

&lt;img src=/intl/fi/nav\_current.gif …  
<http://www.google.se> has /intl/sv/nav\_current.gif…

With this fix it should work with local googles too:

“//img\[contains(@src,’/nav\_current.gif’)”

Very handy script, btw."

378,2005-04-02T00:29:00+00:00,Anonymous,,,comment,0,"This is a great script. Works well with AccessBar (i.e. tells you what keys are defined). I have one suggestion:

In FF, you can turn off the default setting for the Location Bar to make it search google normally instead of the “I’m Feeling Lucky” search.

The default URL when you type something in is e.g. “keyword:soccer”

You should include an “@include keyword:\*” bit in your code.

Cheers!"

381,2005-05-13T13:25:00+00:00,bredend,,,comment,0,"Nice one, used an prev/next extension before but that one was buggy.  
I changed the keys to left Alt+Z and left Alt+X because i still want find-as-you-type.

Let’s see if i can make some ‘macros’ for webbased applications at work."

Error: a has no properties  
Source File: googleaccesskeys.user.js

I added the following code right after you set the variable ‘a’ and it seems to have fixed the problem:  
if (!a) {  
 return;  
}"

I’ve just recently discovered Greasemonkey, and this script would be very useful. Unfortunately, it does not work – I’ve tried it on Windows / Firefox 1.5 at work and on Linux / Firefox 1.5 at home, and nothing happens when I press alt+,/. . Am I missing something or has Google changed their html code? I analyzed html, and script seems to be doing the right think. Any ideas?   
thx"
