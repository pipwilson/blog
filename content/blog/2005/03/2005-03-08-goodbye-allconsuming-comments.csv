I haven’t tried it myself and it’s “down for maintenance” (huh?) right now, but you can check out a cached version [here](http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:www.bookswelike.net) and a brief review [here](http://www.anarchogeek.com/archives/000469.html).

Also, [bibliophil.org](http://bibliophil.org/). Again, haven’t tried it yet, so if you sign up for one of these, I’d love to see a review. 🙂"

347,2005-03-08T14:14:00+00:00,Andrea,,,comment,0,"Whoops. Strike that last statement, I just signed up for bibliophil.org. It pulls data from Amazon.de (a big plus), but the interface and search function need a bit of work.

If you limit a keyword search to the German or UK store and then navigate to the second page of search results, it gives you results from the (default) US store.  
And you can’t set a month or year for read books, but only a specific date or “don’t know”, which seems a bit strange to me (who reads all their books on one day?).  
And some ISBN searches turn up empty pages.

The exported CSV doesn’t look very useful to me (there’s a column called ‘UnknownDateRead’ filled with rows of “TRUE”), although you can, of course, use it to keep an inventory of your library by ISBN.

I might sign up for bookswelike (when it’s up again) for testing purposes, otherwise I’ll probably keep looking too."

Freeware: [eLibPro](http://songstech.com/elibpro.html)Shareware: [Book Library](http://www.wensoftware.com/BookLibrary/)I’m liking the eLibPro interface and will probably play around with it some more. The shareware is a bit too cluttered for my liking and looks a bit ugly.

I will stop spamming you now. 🙂"

I hadn’t gotten as far as investigating alternatives (or even bloging about it :). the blog software I use (drupal) has a book review module. But I’m more interested in keeping track of books I read than reviewing every single one.

So what I’m trying to say is, if you find a really clean solution I expect, no, demand, that you blog about it 😉 in the mean time I’ll go check out andrea’s eLibPro."
350,2005-03-09T19:36:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Thanks for the tips Andrea, I’d not seen any of those sites before!

eLibPro seems pretty decent – nicely customisable too, and because it’s just an Access database, with a well-documented schema, it would be easy to generate any kind of web pages you liked from it, but I think I’m really looking for a web-based solution.

I think my problem is that I’m not entirely sure \*what\* I want! 🙂"

It was web-based, used Amazon database, and was all-around awesome. Export your data often if using web-based, I would say, just in case it disappears. bibliophil looks promising. First decent-looking web-based thing I’ve seen since Singlefile went bye-bye.

I started using ReaderWare a few weeks ago (since you can export to pda nicely) just because I need SOMETHING, but I’m not real fond of it. I really really like being able to email a url of my collection to folks."
