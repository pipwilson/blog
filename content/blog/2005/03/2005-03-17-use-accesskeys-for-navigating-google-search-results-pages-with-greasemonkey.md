The Greasemonkey script: [Enables navigation through Google search results pages using <kbd>ALT+,</kbd> and <kbd>ALT+.</kbd>](http://philwilson.org/code/greasemonkey/google-accesskeys.user.js).

This script enables accesskeys for navigating through pages of Google search results using <kbd>ALT+,</kbd> for “previous page of results” and <kbd>ALT+.</kbd> for “next page of results”. I find it useful, so maybe someone else will too 🙂

I’ve been using Jesse Rudermans [Search Keys Firefox extension](http://www.squarefree.com/extensions/search-keys/) since he first released it. It’s brilliant – when you perform a search on any of the [listed search engines](http://www.squarefree.com/extensions/search-keys/) it inserts the numbers 1-0 after them, and makes them links, so that pressing “1” will take you to the first result, “2” the second, and so on. This has proved very useful for me, because I’m quite the keyboard fan, and tend to search Google from the address bar, and then just press the number of the result I want to see.

The problem was that if the result I wanted wasn’t on the first page then I had to grab my mouse and click “Next”, or use find-as-you-type and hope that the word “next”, or “xt” wasn’t in any of the links already there. This script helps me get around that, so that now I have a guaranteed method of moving between pages of the Google search results. Marvellous.
