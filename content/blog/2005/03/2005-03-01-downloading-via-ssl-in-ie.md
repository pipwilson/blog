Edd Dumbillâ€™s been having problems [getting IE to download dynamically generated files](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/02/26-ie-breaks-my-head/read) and today posted [the solution he discovered](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/02/28-ie-solution/read):

> The sort of situation that causes IE not to cache is either an SSL session, or where caching is turned off for other reasons, such as using PHPâ€™s session facilities. This latter reason was the problem I was having.

> The answer is remarkably simple, which is to add a Cache-control: public header to the download. This causes IE to keep the downloaded file around.

I ran into this about a year ago, and as far as I can remember, this solution *doesnâ€™t work* when the download is both over SSL and your app is hosted by Tomcat behind IIS. I ended up having to both write my own server-side download handler **and** set the `Cache-control` header.

At the time it was all a bit of a last-minute discovery which didnâ€™t get much investigation (both Firefox and Opera worked fine without any additional work which is why I hadnâ€™t seen it earlier), and I just went with the first working solution, so if anyone knows better, please let me know ðŸ™‚
