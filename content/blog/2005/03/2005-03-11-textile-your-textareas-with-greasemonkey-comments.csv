Do you think it would be useful to inject a second textarea that you put your textile stuff in that updates the original text area with the html-ed text?

Still won’t help you after you’ve hit post but it might be better than now."

Dual textareas, one for input, the other for the output, would help things somewhat. More compact would be to have a button that toggles between the transformed and untransformed text. However, I’m not sure it would be enough better to make it worthwhile for my sloppy and impatient self.

What might be cool is to store the original text with some persistance and have a button for recovering it.  
If it persisted within a browswer session, it would be useful for thos e situations when I’m making a one-off entry in some system I have no control over (like this one), that I might want to preview, but I’m unlikely and/or unable to return to later and edit.

If it persisted across browswer sessions, that would open it to a wider range of uses. From my point of view, I’m not sure how much utility it adds, since I don’t enter much text into systems I don’t control that I might want to return to and edit later. On the otherhand, someone using Blogger might.

I don’t know much about javascript, but as I recall, its possible to do something like this as far as storing the text(I think SquirrelMail uses it to store drafts).

Ideally the Greasemonkey script would have some context awareness and only present the cached source-text relevant to the form in question.

This could be accomplished a few ways.

1\) URL matching, but URLs can change.  
2\) Hostname matching  
3\) Matching of the contents of the textarea with a transformed version of the cached text (with allowances for differences in whitespace &amp; captitalization).

\#3 is probably the highest precision."

You’re right though, the ability to keep editing the original textile text would be really good (especially seeing as I’ve just fallen foul of it myself!).

I’ll definitely give it a go."

I have a version which keeps the original text, I’ll clean it up and update the main script."

I just posted a small rewrite of Jeff Mainard’s script, do you believe there interest in rewriting the greasemonkey script?

My post explaining what I did is here:
