As a workaround, you could implement a proxy that injects the special ‘in a meeting’ presences towards the server, and let the real client in the dark about it. You may also need to intercept and process the presence packets from the real client.

I’ve started work on something like this, which actually does both above mentioned solutions. Due to changes in priorities it is now waiting to be worked on again, however…"

At the very least it should be possible to hack a normal HTTP or SOCKS proxy to perform the calendar/status checking for the client. This would mean that it would actually work on every client, plus could lead to future extensibility for other related tasks.

A Jabber-specific proxy would probably be better, but I think for at least getting started then hacking something that already exists is a reasonable thing to do."

Another possibility would be to put the calendar app on the Jabber network and using the remote control JEP, set your other client’s status to away.

For a quick hack DBUS is probably the way to go, and is supposedly being worked on. A Jabberfied calendar would be to sexy to live without though:

Calendar app: “Hey, I’m busy. Is there a better time for you?”, “I’m still busy, but I’m open…”

Ah, the things that can be done."

Only the day after I made this post I read the remote-control JEP and saw Remko’s screenshots – this looks very cool and probably the easiest thing to do (presuming that other clients would be likely to have remote control support before they have a DBUS plugin). This would be really cool to have."
