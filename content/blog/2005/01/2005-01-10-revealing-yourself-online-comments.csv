I guess more seriously, this is a fantastic resource for social engineering."

What can they do with all that? Just about anything that collection of Ph.Ds can dream up.” *[Jason Kottke (6 April, 2004](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kottke.org%2F04%2F04%2Fgoogle-operating-system)*What I *choose* to give away about myself doesn’t keep me awake at night! Should I be worried about what else can be gleaned? Or should I say with Scott McNeally (speaking in **1999**, “You already have zero privacy. Get over it”? More thoughts [here](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.preoccupations.org%2F2004%2F09%2Fprivacy_transpa.html).

Two other thoughts: through these mechanisms, we are making contacts and communicating in ways hitherto undreamt of. In this I see great potential for future good, but it would be very naive not to see how it could all be exploited to other, less desirable ends. And secondly, what also strikes me is how much is *left out* about ourselves in these partial, digital traces we are leaving in virtual space: eg, I don’t usually play classical music on my laptop, so it doesn’t appear on Audioscrobbler; much of my reading and teaching never makes it to my blog; etc, etc."

Pretty long list, even after unsubscribing from and deleting services and accounts I didn’t use anymore (which in itself kept me occupied for quite a while).

I don’t know about you, but I can still trick myself into believing in some sort of “anonymity” as long as I don’t use my last name nor put my picture online. It’s a comforting illusion, sometimes.

And as David said, it’s almost more interesting to see how much information about ourselves we \*don’t\* put online. Or rather, which part(s) of us we reveal to certain groups of people we know online.

Babblebabblebabble. 🙂"

David, you’re right of course, I hadn’t even thought about what we don’t say about ourselves – my post was more focussed on the speed with which even a stranger can gather large amounts of information about a person (although that information is deliberately selective of course, and potentially misleading) solely from their website.

Andrea, if you’ve managed to keep track of all the services which you’ve signed up to but don’t use then you’re already doing far better than me. 🙂"
