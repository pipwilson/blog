Right on schedule, Gez has posted an article about [Getting Things Done with WikidPad](http://geekanddiva.com/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=GettingThingsDoneOnwikidPad). It’s a good article covering all the basics, but you’ll probably need a copy of [WikidPad](http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/) to hand in order to really understand it – there’s a lot to absorb.
