[CWjobs.co.uk](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/) is the first website Iâ€™ve seen, outside of specialist services like Feedster, which [provides the results of searches in RSS feeds](http://www.cwjobs.co.uk/rss_help.asp).

Although itâ€™s an excellent use of the technology to provide users with information, I wonder how many people use it? Most job websites send out the results of searches by email, and most people will want to have all the different search results arrive in one place, meaning that an RSS feed will typically be under-used for this purpose, possibly sending a signal to the company that itâ€™s not worth bothering with, despite the fact that it could have a higher take up in other areas of the company.

Regardless though, itâ€™s amazing to see such a comparatively niche technology penetrate this far.

Itâ€™s just a pity [they donâ€™t validate](http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cwjobs.co.uk%2Frss.asp%3FjobType1%3D%26PostedDays%3D7%26Keywords%3D%26Sort%3D1%26Locations%3D) ðŸ˜‰
