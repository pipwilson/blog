About a year ago (or maybe more) I stopped using [Bloggerâ€™s](http://www.blogger.com/) web posting interface and started using [w.bloggar](http://www.wbloggar.com) because whilst writing my post Iâ€™d be looking up resources, gathering quotes etc. etc. and just every now and again my browser (whether it was IE or Firefox) would crash, leaving me with nothing.

Just over the past month or two Iâ€™ve been getting back to using Bloggerâ€™s web interface, even when Iâ€™m on my home computer. So, I was just finishing a post that was a couple of hundred words long, and guess what happened? ðŸ™‚

So, at the very least as a note to myself â€“ use a desktop tool to compose your posts! It could even be notepad! Donâ€™t be a dumbass!

Thanks.
