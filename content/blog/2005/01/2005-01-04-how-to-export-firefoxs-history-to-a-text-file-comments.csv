i get the following error in the firefox javascript-console:

in english this stands for, that firefox denied the priviliges to run this script.

anyone has an idea how to get this one running?

Type “about:config” in your Firefox address bar and type “xpconnect” into the text box marked “filter” and check that the preference “security.xpconnect.plugin.unrestricted” is marked as “true”. I \*think\* that’s the problem you’re having."

security.xpconnect.plugin.unrestricted is true in about:config.

Any other ideas?"
243,2005-06-12T14:05:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"Yes – you need to viewing a local HTML page in Firefox before you click the bookmarklet.

Just view any webpage, save it to disk (or create a new page on your hard drive), load it in Firefox then click the link. Loading the local page puts Firefox into a lower security mode which lets the bookmarklet access the files on the hard drive."

I’ve spent some of today looking for something like this and it worked great. Only trouble is how can I import the file onto another FireFox installation.

The user got a new PC is the reason.

247,2005-09-01T13:38:00+00:00,Pip,,,comment,0,"If you need to move the Firefox history between machines, you *should* just be able to copy the history.dat file from the profile directory:

\* close Firefox on both computers  
\* find the profile directory on each computer (on Windows this will be something like C:Documents and SettingsUsernameApplication DataMozillaFirefoxProfilessdfkjsh4.default)  
\* copy the history.dat from the source profile directory to the destination profile directory

I believe that should work just fine."

But it is incomplete in the way that it does not recognize back button actions and does not distiguish beetween link following and typing in an URL in the adress field. Is there a way to enrich the history with that data?"

i made a little webpage for this script. would be interesting if it works with other history files than mine.

in the future i will optimize the script and perhaps add some enhancements.

257,2006-01-25T19:39:00+00:00,Anonymous,,,comment,0,"Phil, please help! I accessed your file about moving Firefox’s history to text, and it worked great. The only problem is, the history.dat file shows a whole bunch of files that the history.rtf.txt does not (the history.rtf.txt only shows the last nine days). I want to find out the dates accessed for all of these files in history.dat. Is there any way for me to do that?

Also, if a user goes into Firefox and goes to the history, and deletes a specific site (just right-clicks and hits delete, like that), will that site still show up in history.dat, or in the text version?

Please help – I’m really desperate to figure this out. Thanks in advance! I’m at ubergottin @ herzeleid . net if you want to email me directly, or post here. (I tried to follow the link on the “contact you” part of this site, but it didn’t work for me.)

Suggestions to Keith and other users:

1\. Every time you run it it will OVERWRITE any history.txt file it previously created, so if you don’t want to lose your “history history” you had better move or rename the existing one.

(The above fact is in the Dork readme.txt but the following warning is not.)

2\. If you run it with Firefox running you will get:

ERROR: Could not open file. Error 32

which apparently means the file is in use by another application (in this case, I closed Firefox and Dork seems to work perfectly).

Try adding the following lines to your user.js file located in your profile dir (create it, if it does not exist):

user\_pref(“capability.principal.philwilson.id”, “http://philwilson.org”);  
user\_pref(“capability.principal.philwilson.granted”, “UniversalXPConnect”);
