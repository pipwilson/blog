FOAFlicious is an application for generating a [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/) file from your [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) inbox.

FOAFlicious is written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/ "a new agile dynamic language for the JVM combining lots of great features from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk and making them available to the Java developers using a Java-like syntax."), and can be seen in action on <http://philwilson.org:8180/foaflicious/foaflicious.groovy> (hopefully this URL will become better in time).

This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever used Groovy and so far Iâ€™ve not been able to configure it to accept URL parameters (answers on a postcard please) so itâ€™s currently hardcoded to return a FOAF file based on [my del.icio.us inbox](http://del.icio.us/pip "my del.icio.us inbox"), hereâ€™s looking at v0.2 ðŸ™‚

The del.icio.us inbox facility is currently turned off except for the list of subscriptions so it currently works by masses of screen-scraping. As soon as the inbox comes back it should be able to switch to using the [del.icio.us API](http://del.icio.us/doc/api) (probably using David Czarneckiâ€™s [delicious-java API](http://sourceforge.net/projects/delicious-java/)).

Currently it uses the del.icio.us page for each user listed in your inbox to extract a userâ€™s real name and homepage, then looks at their homepage to see if they have a FOAF autodiscovery link, and if so includes it in a `<rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="blah"/>` block.

The (terrible) code is available on <http://philwilson.org/projects/foaflicious/foaflicious-0.1.groovy>. it was only written in a couple of hours, so no abuse please ðŸ™‚ In order to run it youâ€™ll need the Groovy libraries, [commons-httpclient](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/), [commons-logging](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/) and [JTidy](http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/).

If you want to stay notified about this project, it has [its own feed](http://philwilson.org/projects/foaflicious/atom.xml).

For reasons of my own sanity, you can add comments and questions about this [over here](http://philwilson.org/projects/foaflicious/2005/01/foaflicious-01.html).
