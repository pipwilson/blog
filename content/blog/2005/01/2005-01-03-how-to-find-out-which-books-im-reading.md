[Andrea wants to be able to stalk my reading list](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/12/tracking-comments.html#110415097301576089).

I use [allconsuming.net](http://allconsuming.net/) to keep track of which books I‚Äôm reading, which ones I‚Äôve completed, which are my favourites, and so on.

When I start or finish a book I load up Firefox, select the Amazon search engine from the search box, type in the ISBN from the back of the book and then click [my consume! bookmarklet](http://philwilson.org/blog/2004/09/allconsumingnet-amazon-bookmarklet.html), select a status, and hit ‚Äúsave‚Äù (adding some extra book metadata if I‚Äôm feeling particularly generous with my time) at which point the book is added to my list.

Anyone is then able to browse those books on <http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://www.philwilson.org/blog/> letting them see [what I‚Äôm currently reading](http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://www.philwilson.org/blog/&view=being_read), [what I‚Äôve finished reading](http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://www.philwilson.org/blog/&view=completed) and [ what my favourite books are](http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://www.philwilson.org/blog/&view=favorite_books).

What, however, I had planned to do for this site, was to utilise [the RSS feed for the books I‚Äôm currently reading](http://www.allconsuming.net/xml/users/currently_reading.pipthepixie.rss.xml) (also available in a proprietary XML format either [via REST](http://allconsuming.net/rest.cgi?action=GetCurrentlyReadingList&username=pipthepixie) or [pre-generated XML file](http://www.allconsuming.net/xml/users/currently_reading.pipthepixie.xml)) and the PHP-based [Magpie RSS Parser](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) to display a list, but it turns out that not only does the ‚Äòcurrently reading‚Äô RSS file not provide links to images, All Consuming only provides RSS feeds for your ‚Äúcurrently reading‚Äù and ‚Äúfavourite books‚Äù lists, not which ones you‚Äôve completed, which you‚Äôve bought, never finished, and so on so the best I would be able to come up with would be [something like this](http://philwilson.org/books/simpledemo.php).

So. Until I get around to either writing a stylesheet for converting All Consuming‚Äôs XML format (which includes a link to a picture of the cover from Amazon.com) into RSS (or I find one on the web) or something which parses it directly, you‚Äôll have to make do with [my page on All Consuming](http://allconsuming.net/weblog.cgi?url=http://www.philwilson.org/blog/).

So Andrea, happy now? üôÇ
