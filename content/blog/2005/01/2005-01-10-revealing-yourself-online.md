Isn’t it amazing just how much we reveal about ourselves on our weblogs now?

Some link on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) took me to a weblog called “[Preoccupations](http://www.preoccupations.org/)“. Within five minutes, I knew [who the writer is and where he works](http://smith.typepad.com/about.html), [what kind of music he likes](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/Ludens/), [what interests him](http://del.icio.us/Preoccupations), [his hometown](http://www.flickr.com/people/ludens/), [where he’s been](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ludens/tags/) and [what he sees](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ludens/).

Of course, all this info is available about me, and any number of other people, but I was just stunned at how quickly I was able to gather together all this information.
