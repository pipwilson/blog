I signed up for allconsuming.net some time ago, but [my list](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fallconsuming.net%2Fweblog.cgi%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fcuriouser.revise.org%2F) isn’t terribly interesting, as I haven’t yet gotten around to including comments or ratings for each book. And it doesn’t search the Amazon.**de** inventory, so it’s not the perfect solution for me anyway.

Did you ever think of using the Javascript include? Just wondering.

I didn’t realise that it wouldn’t search the Amazon.de inventory; you’d have thought that given an ISBN for a German book it would have at least tried to retrieve details from the .de website. That’s quite depressing.

I wouldn’t quite call my throwaway one-liners about books reviews 😉

There are a few things about allconsuming that I’d like to be better (like support for ratings and dates books are added and so on), some of which [Alf Eaton’s RVW tool](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Falf.hubmed.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Frvw.cgi) deals with, but it isn’t as pretty or as comprehensive (it also claims to support amazon.de, but a quick test crashes it :).

Also, I don’t think there’s any work on allconsuming going on – the guy behind it is now working on the recently released [43things.com](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.43things.com) which is a real shame."

That’s another reason why I’m not using the service as much as I could (and I don’t need to keep track of six books at a time ;-)). Searching for the ISBN didn’t even occur to me before, but no, that doesn’t search Amazon.de either. Oh well.

Playing around with rvw! right now, way cool app. It does work with German books for me, it just doesn’t handle umlauts very well. Or at all.

Heh, ‘stop procrastinating’ is at #4 on [43things zeitgeist](http://www.blogger.com/r?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.43things.com%2Fzeitgeist%2F). I can sooo relate.

I just wanted to say that you’ve got me, Rakka, and now Nyx hooked on allconsuming. Great find."
