If you’re a regular user you’ll have already noticed by now, but in case you hadn’t – [del.icio.us inbox is back!](http://lists.burri.to/pipermail/delicious-discuss/2005-January/001673.html) (via [WaxyLinks](http://waxy.org/links/)).

If you’ve not used the inbox functionality before, it’s basically a mini-aggregator for del.icio.us, so that when you’re viewing another user’s del.icio.us bookmarks (say, [mine](http://del.icio.us/pip)), you can click “subscribe” at the top of the page, and then all of that user’s bookmarks will appear in your inbox ([see my inbox for an example](http://del.icio.us/inbox/pip)). This makes it much easier to manage subscriptions to multiple del.icio.us accounts.

Not only that, but you can also subscribe to a user’s tags and to global tags, so for example you could subscribe to [my bookmarks about jabber](http://del.icio.us/pip/jabber "what I'm filing under 'jabber'"), or [everyone’s](http://del.icio.us/tag/jabber "What all del.icio.us users are filing under 'jabber'")! Marvellous!
