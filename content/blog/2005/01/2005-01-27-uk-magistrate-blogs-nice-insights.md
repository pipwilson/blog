There’s an [interesting new blog on the block](http://thelawwestofealingbroadway.blogspot.com/ " The Law West of Ealing Broadway"), written by a UK magistrate (thanks [LinkMachineGo](http://www.timemachinego.com/linkmachinego/2005_01_01_archive.php#110675017330327896 "neo-maxi zoom linky")!), which, amongst the humour, makes some very serious points:

> As the politicians vie for the law’n’order vote the police have been given lots of expensive new toys to catch criminals, but once those criminals go to court it’s back to a 10p Bic pen and an A4 pad.

Good stuff.
