So, I finally finished the move from one host to another. It should not have taken as long as it did but after a frustrating night with the nginx config I spent a few days unwinding and catching up with the BBCâ€™s new light entertainment series for Saturday nights, [Merlin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dr74v/episodes/2008) by watching it on iPlayer. My god I love iPlayer. Itâ€™s amazing. Even though I already have a PVR which the wife and I use heavily, iPlayer has still changed how we think about and watch TV. Awesome.

Anyway.

In the process of moving server I also moved from my blog being served from Apache+mod\_php to Nginx+fastcgi (in particular I followed these instructions: [Perfect Setup: Ubuntu Hardy+Nginx+MySQL5+PHP5+Wordress](http://www.mensk.com/webmaster-toolbox/perfect-ubuntu-hardy-nginx-mysql5-php5-wordpress/)). I learnt a few things, although Iâ€™m sure most lessons will become apparent over the coming weeks. ðŸ˜‰

Firstly, [nginx](http://nginx.net/) is amazing. In-place binary upgrades; simpler (to me) config files; faster; smaller; less memory overheard. If memory is no object to you, then youâ€™re probably safe staying with Apache2, otherwise Iâ€™d recommend the switch.

fastcgi is less good, taking more memory than Iâ€™d like, although itâ€™s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison because of course Apache2 masks the PHP usage. This may also be throwing off the nginx vs. Apache2 comparisons between my servers but only by a small amount I hope.

Another reason Iâ€™ve taken to nginx is that the documentation seems to have made a leap that Apache2â€™s never seems to have managed. That is to say, it is [a user-friendly wiki](http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main) with sections for both [user-contributed recipes](http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxConfiguration) as well as a [complete config reference](http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxModules). Apacheâ€™s documentation has always been a source of pain to me, and itâ€™s almost always guaranteed that the answer youâ€™re looking for is on someoneâ€™s blog or in a mailing list somewhere rather than closer to the main docs and having some vague authority of being halfway accurate.

Of course, this may just be because Apache2 is now a venerable beast (or at least the docs that also apply to Apache are), but it makes a big difference.

Anyway, I look forward to a world of excitement with my new nginx setup. I have yet to set up proper logging (like filtering 404s and logrotate for specific site logs) and I have a mass of images and videos still to bring over from my old site, plus wordpress maintenance like theme-munging and plugin installation, and at some point it might be nice to actually have [a home pageâ€¦](http://philwilson.org)
