There is some current hullabaloo over [twitter’s most recent hires](http://www.valuesofn.com/blog/2008/11/fork-in-road.html).

I agree with the commenters on that post. Shutting down productivity tools with two weeks’ notice is an big, big problem.

Worse for me is the implication that Twitter are content for this to happen and content to hire people who do this (the commenters have also picked up on this).

The only salvageable situation would seem to either keep the services running or [as Justin Mason suggests](http://www.valuesofn.com/blog/2008/11/fork-in-road.html#62785167944970300), open sourcing them.

I think this is the Twitter exit warning for me.
