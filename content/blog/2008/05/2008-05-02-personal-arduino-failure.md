So next week is [XTech 2008](http://2008.xtech.org/) and I’m not going.

Last year’s was excellent though and one of the more physical results was that I bought myself an Arduino board and related gumpf.

However, in a very anti-hacker sentiment, I haven’t done anything interesting with it at all, mainly out of a concern for breaking it! Another guy in my office has also got one and has happily burned through resistors and capacitors but I can’t help but think that if I did something like that I’d have *done it wrong* somehow.

I obviously need to steel myself and get embrace the lack-of-concern needed to develop some cool physical products!
