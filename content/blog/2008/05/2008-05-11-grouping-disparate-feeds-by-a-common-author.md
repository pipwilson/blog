Iâ€™ve been thinking about the user interaction of subscribing to feeds and how, and at which point, to identify that a particular feed belongs to a particular person when you already subscribe to another feed coming from that person (i.e. subscribing to their delicious feed when youâ€™re already subscribed to their blog).

Iâ€™d been trying to think of an easy way of typing in, or selecting the authorâ€™s real name, thus tying multiple feeds to a single individual (assuming that the feed doesnâ€™t contain enough information to be able to deduce this already).

It took me a day or so of idling mulling in my spare time that itâ€™s really solved by tagging and system-provided usernames. I am â€˜pipâ€™ on most of the systems I use; Paul Mison is â€˜blechâ€™. This is easily identifiable information from each feed, but if itâ€™s not there, or different for any given service then itâ€™s still quicker and easier to enter as a feed-level tag than the full name for a person.

The moral of the story is to look at the solutions youâ€™re given rather than inventing new problems ðŸ™‚
