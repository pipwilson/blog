[Agent Frank](http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank) was super-useful as a personal proxy back in the day, but in the end it introduced too much of a delay into my daily browsing and I turned it off.

Now that Firefox’s history is powered by a SQLite database I was hoping to be able to query it for my history every x minutes, request the pages and store and index them locally.

The documentation of SQLite on [MDC](http://developer.mozilla.org/) seems to be [quite lightweight](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Storage) but what it does tell us is this:

“How to corrupt your database: Open the database from an external program while it is open in Mozilla”

Balls. Other ideas?
