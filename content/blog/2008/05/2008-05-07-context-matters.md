Itâ€™s nice to see that the person-centred aggregation meme [has surfaced](http://mildlydiverting.blogspot.com/2008/04/rss-aggregation-as-friend-filter.html) in [a couple of other places](http://laughingmeme.org/2008/05/02/friendfeed-is-too-much-info/) recently, where that personâ€™s contextual relation to you is shown to be important.

I still have no good idea how to address that ðŸ™‚
