wxVenus is, at the moment, a desktop tool for browsing the cache that a local [Venus](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus) installation creates when it runs. It is written in [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) and is dependent on [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/).

It is also the first Python program of greater than ten lines that Iâ€™ve ever written, and given that [weâ€™ve already established I am very bad at it](http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/11/parsing-atom-with-libxml2), the code quality is very low.

The long-term intention is to provide a cross-platform desktop tool which uses either a local or remote Venus installation as its aggregator and data source. <del>At the moment I am using [Lighthouse](http://www.lighthouseapp.com/) to track progress, but the free account doesnâ€™t let me expose my tickets publically (although I *will* use [the API](http://www.lighthouseapp.com/api) to do this)</del><ins> [Iâ€™ve moved to Google code](http://wxvenus.googlecode.com) because Lighthouse was closed and my local Trac install was slower than you could possibly imagine</ins>.

Really this is a lesson in [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/), [Python](http://python.org/), [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) and XML parsing. Hopefully I will end up with a tool I can use. So far Iâ€™m learning a lot ðŸ™‚
