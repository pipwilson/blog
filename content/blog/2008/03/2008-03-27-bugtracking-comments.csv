I’ve migrated SamePlace from trac to Launchpad and am quite happy with it. It does support bzr, both hosted and remote."

<http://lighthousepro.riaforge.org/>

It is a free package that runs on coldfusion. I do not know if it works with the Blue Dragon (which will be open source by june of this year) [http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/open\_source/overview.cfm](http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/open_source/overview.cfm)

Perhaps not the perfect solution but it would be one you would have control over."

It is for sure simple, fast, and free.

It has the same approach as FogBugz with regards to no required fields; comments, attachments displayed in a narrative; a screen capture utility that let’s you turn a screenshot into a bug entry in three clicks…

The three screenshots at the bottom of the following link show that it’s not only easy to add more fields if you need them, but it’s easy to REMOVE the ones you don’t need:

Here’s what other folks have written about it:
