[OpenTech 2008 has been announced!](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2008/)

> an informal, low cost one-day conference on technology, society and low-carbon living (Saturday 5th July 2008 in Central London).

The last OpenTech was in 2005 just a few days after [the attempted bomb attacks in London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_July_2005_London_bombings) and was totally awesome. It saw [Ewan’s iPod Shuffle Shuffle](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/2005/07/24/the-apple-ipod-shuffle-shuffle-from-opentech-2005/) the forming of [the ORG](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/) (I’d totally forgotten that this was where it happened until [Suw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suw_Charman) reminded me at XTech last year), and loads of other stuff.

It was totally excellent, and I’d definitely recommend it to all UK-based geeks, especially since it only costs a fiver on the door. Frankly, I can’t imagine how they won’t have to be turning people away.

If you want to get a feel for what it was like last time, take a gander at [my Flickr photos from OpenTech 2005](http://www.flickr.com/groups/81873498@N00/) and [all photos tagged opentech](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/opentech/)
