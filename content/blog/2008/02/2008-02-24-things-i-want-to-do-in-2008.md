- write a new open source application, however small
- contribute [in some way to mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/volunteertasks)
- find out more about what rights I have to see how and when my data is used by Government departments
- write to my ([pro-ID cards](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/kerry_mccarthy/bristol_east)) MP about ID cards and data protection
- make sure that my donation to [ORG](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/) is set up correctly

Also, some boring things like:

- make sure Iâ€™m putting the full amount into my ISA every year
- get a house without going bankrupt
- learn to drive

What else should I be doing this year?
