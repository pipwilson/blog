For what it’s worth, I typically use [Fring](http://www.fring.com/) for all my VoIP needs."

I also use Fring, but don’t have an unlimited data contract, so keep my Fring usage to when I have WiFi nearby, and use Three’s Skype otherwise."

As for the backup options I would recomend using MOBILedit to backup everything.  
I think I’ll be able to get everything back from it:  
Phonebook, organizer, messages, even the files.

I ‘ll send new comment when I’m done 🙂"
