Tim Bray has possibly made his [last-ever optical media purchase](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/12/Slides-Done).

A few weeks ago I bought an [NSLU2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2). I have two 8GB USB keys in geographic rotation to perform always-on, silent, transparent backups for our critical data. I initially thought that I’d upgrade the firmware to [Unslung](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Unslung/HomePage), but it practice the native firmware has done the job so well that I haven’t had to do anything. I love this solution.

In the comments on Tim’s piece, [“Thomas” comments](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/12/Slides-Done#c1202829836.919772):

> Flash memory requires periodic access or the cells’ charge drops below the readability threshold. Optical media kept in cool dark storage should last much longer than flash.

This is a bit of a worry to me, as I was hoping to take all my photo CDs, stick them on a suitably large USB key, and lose it in a drawer somewhere. I wonder if this is the case for [SSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)s as well? If I don’t turn my Macbook Air on for 6 months, will I not have a hard drive any more?
