The problem is he didn’t call a general election when he first became prime minister. Retrospectively he should have called one the moment he took the premiership, instead he waited until the opposition called for one, so he couldn’t call one without conceding. Labour still would have had a better chance then. It seems like the media is much less enchanted with Gordon Brown than it was by Tony Blair. Did he forget to go and see Rupert Murdoch? Why is he not complaining too and scaring the BBC about their negative coverage of him?

I don’t think Labour can win in the next elections whatever they do, they have to take some losses and try to recover from them. It would be political suicide for either of the above to talk openly about the fact they will lose, but I think that is the reality, they really need try and save their own seats.

I think it will be very bad for Labour if Gordon Brown stepped aside for the next candidate, they have a chance to show how strong they are by forcing him to step down. However I don’t see anyone Brave enough to step forwards to try and defeat Blair-Wannabe David Cameron.

I want to see the end of the pointless factions in party politics, we need to have more independent candidates, or at least some who can resist the main views of their parties?!

I think the current lot are beyond contempt, how can they make a law which allows the police to hold someone without charging them for 28 days or longer? Or deporting citizens to another country without any evidence needing to be presented here?"
