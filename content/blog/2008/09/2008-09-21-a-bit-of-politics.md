It was interesting earlier today to watch [Charles Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Clarke) and [John Prescott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott) on the BBC’s Politics Show talking about the future of [Gordon Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_brown) and the Labour party. On hand Charles Clarke is a Brown sceptic and wants there to be a leadership contest to take us into the next European and General elections whilst John Prescott argues this would take too long and lead to defeat in those same elections so the Labour party should rally around Brown for the next two years until the General election is won. Both want the Labour party to win the next election so hearing from the both was quite educational – far more so than the usual Labour vs. Conservative debates.

[The whole thing can be watched on the website](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7618279.stm) (for now at least).
