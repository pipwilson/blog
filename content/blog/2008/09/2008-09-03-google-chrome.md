(because one more whiny blogger’s opinion can’t hurt)

- nice, fast.
- I see ad people
- a single google doc in an application window feels nicer than [the Prism alternative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism)
- masses of the standard Firefox keyboard shortcuts work
- find-as-you-type requires CTRL+F
- find-as-you-type doesn’t select links
- NO FEED SUPPORT AT ALL

I look forward to the first Linux build which runs Chrome as its window manager.
