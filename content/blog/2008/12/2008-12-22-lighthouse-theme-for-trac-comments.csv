The only weird thing I found is that it sets “#ticket .description h3” and “#content #newticket label\[for=type\], #content #newticket #type” to display:none…

\#ticket .description h3 {  
 color: #006699;

 font-size: 1.0em;

 border-bottom: 1px solid #006699;

 display: block;

}"

 \* ticket type was hidden  
 \* textarea width  
 \* cooler and smaller layout for the ticket properties table layout  
 \* cooler layout for tables inside the ticket description  
 \* added a definition list layout  
 \* wiki content h1, h3…"

Best regards,
