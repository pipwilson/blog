Maybe you need to log every keystroke?"

On the other hand, if all your sites support OpenSearch it should be straightforward to build a metasearch page.

What about mirroring your del.icio.us, Flickr, twitter, etc items locally so that they can be indexed like any other files?"

Have you tried Evernote? I use it for general “stuff”."

FWIW I like Tudumo very much, not just the L&amp;F. It’s a very well-put-together application."

The real reason for my comment is that I think you’ve inspired a term that should exist: “morissettic” which would mean ironic, although possibly in an Alanis Morissette way. It’s going in my dictionary."
