Well, “preparing” might be overstating it, but this weekend I’ll be [Mashed 08](http://mashed08.backnetwork.com/default.aspx) so it’s nice to read [posts like this from Ewan Spence](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/2008/06/18/top-ten-tips-to-survive-the-bbc-mashed-experience/) giving us mere mortals some hints on how to survive. It’s also interesting to see Ewan’s [notes on his project](http://socialflightsim.wordpress.com/) for Mashed, which he started two days ago – this certainly gives some context for how pre-planned some people’s “24 hour” hacks are, and makes me think I should do some prep for what I’d like to do (although hopefully someone I bump into will have a better idea which I can join in on!).
