Want an easy way to pass around [a long and hard-to-remember URL](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/06/the_simple_joys_of_webscale_id.shtml) for a BBC programme?[![bbc-qrcode](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/bbc-qrcode-thumb.jpg)](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/bbc-qrcode.jpg)

As of six months ago, and apparently unadvertised, the BBC started providing [QR codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_codes) for every page in [their /programmes section](http://bbc.co.uk/programmes) – just add /qrcode to any existing /programmes link.

The page for recent episodes of Doctor Who is [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0 "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0") and so the QR code is available on [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0/qrcode](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0/qrcode "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0") – the same holds true for individual episodes.

Members of the Future Media and Technology group have blogged about it [here](http://www.whomwah.com/2008/02/24/rqrcode-a-ruby-library-for-encoding-qr-codes) and [here](http://derivadow.com/2008/01/21/qr-codes-for-bbc-programmes-and-some-other-stuff/).
