Older generations already have the financial and political power in this country.

We are already seeing a massive diversion of resources into supporting them e.g. NHS etc., unless the younger generations get their act together this will continue."

I can’t see younger generations getting their act together, either.

Frankly so long as they’re publicly active in sufficient numbers for it to matter (maybe five million or so), I don’t really care."

Younger people now face a problem that the older generation is changing, the number of benevolent old people that lived through a world war and believed some ideology is decreasing, more individualistic/selfish older people want to know why they should leave anything behind for the rest of us."

People always say respect your elders. I guess we should probably start. One possible comfort is that one day we will replace the old people and gain the power."
