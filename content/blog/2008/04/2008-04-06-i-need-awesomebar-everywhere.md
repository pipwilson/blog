For the past six months or so I’ve been using the [Autocomplete Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2300) for Firefox. From my perspective, it’s what has inspired [AwesomeBar](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/03/25/awesomebar). The problem is that I only had it installed at work. At home I was happy to struggle on with plebianbar.

Since I upgraded all my Firefox installations to use the latest beta, I have had a serious problem – neither Windows Explorer nor Nautilus implement the same “find the location quickly” feature that awesomebar encapsulates. This means that at least three times a day, I find myself typing a fraction of a disk location into a file explorer window and being confronted with absolutely nothing. In a worst-case scenario I hit ENTER so early that I get back a page of search results before I can amend it to be an absolute location; maybe this is actually a best-case scenario – it’s unsatisfactory in any case.

I *seriously* need AwesomeBar in my file explorers.
