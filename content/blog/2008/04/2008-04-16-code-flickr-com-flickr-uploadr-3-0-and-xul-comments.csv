The ability to link custom native libraries (think GraphicsMagick and FFmpeg) and true multi-threading were my main reasons for choosing XULRunner.

On top of that, the vast majority of the source code is actually JavaScript, not C++. Take it for a spin, it’s actually more inviting than you may think!"
