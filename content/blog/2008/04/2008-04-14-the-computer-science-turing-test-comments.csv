I suggest starting off with understanding the natural join, and then follow up with the rest.

I also recommend reading up on CJ Date, and EF Codd’s works."

And then I ended up working on a database-centric application which required me to write so many SQL JOIN statements that at one point the built in mental parser just clicked in. 🙂"

e.g. SELECT \* FROM table1 a,table2 b WHERE a.field=b.field

But I appreciate that writing that kind of thing is, these days, on a par with farting at the in-laws dinner table."
