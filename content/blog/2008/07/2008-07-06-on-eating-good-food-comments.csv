Just mindless nibbling while sitting in front of the computer working all day. Not good. I’ve been trying to motivate myself to change that habit and videos like this, do a lot for it. Like, that 4 year old McDonald’s burger video.. have you seen it? I haven’t been to a fast food place since I saw that one. Just can’t stomach it when I become conscious of what I’m really putting in me."

Jones",bkjones@gmail.com,http://www.protocolostomy.com,comment,0,"I was lucky to grow up with some knowledge of what “good food” actually was, even if it was impractical or inconvenient to always have handy. At least as I grew older I was empowered with that knowledge when I went out to fend for myself. It’s served me well to be suspicious and question every sign in the grocery store. I’m thrilled that Mark Bittmann points out how ludicrous the “organic” label is when seen in the context of a trip to the grocery store, and when its older definition is compared to an FDA-approved one. Disgusting, really.

Another thing that’s helped my wife and I eat better is that we \*both\* have a love for cooking. On a stove, using little more than fire and time, and making real food. We aren’t locavores, but we buy local where it makes sense. We aren’t vegetarian or vegan, but our diet is probably closer to what you’d call “healthy” than many. NOte I said “diet”. We still have “exercise” to work on before we can say we’re really “healthy”. Baby steps. 😉"
