Anyone care to explain why the video embedded in [my last post](http://philwilson.org/blog/2008/07/on-eating-good-food) destroys my weblog formatting? Or rather, why WordPress’ parsing of the HTML seems to have gone on an insane rampage?

Let me guess, there’s a [plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/) for that, right?
