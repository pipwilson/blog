Interesting question, hopefully you’ll be posting some conclusions on the topic after the event! I guess each institution’s developers will end up being utilised customising services to add features needed by that institution – maybe that way, for example, we could rid ourselves of misspellings such as “insitution” in workshop abstracts submitted for conferences? 😛

I suspect the conclusions will be along the lines of: “be honest about what you don’t need to do”, “focus on what makes you different from commercial software” and “communicate better”.

To relate that to the typo: the interesting point of course is that everything is DIY until a 3rd-party competitor comes along which can do a better job. In the case of IWMW I’d recommend using <http://www.expectnation.com/> next year rather than writing all their HTML by hand (which is what they do at the moment)."

New buy-ins tend to increase our workload, and that’s when they’ve been a success. Evolving requirements and user uptake, training, maintenance (and building cool stuff on top) all being factors.

I can’t see you putting yourself out of a job 🙂 so I’m itching to know what you all conclude.

Hope Aberdeen’s treating you well. Save us a sweet!"
