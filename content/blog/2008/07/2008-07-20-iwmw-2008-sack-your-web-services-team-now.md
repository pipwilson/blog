Actually, please don’t do that, I’ll have to get off my bum and look for another job.

It is, however, part of the conversation I’ll be having in my parallel session titled “[What’s the Point of having Developers in a Web 2.0 World?](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2008/sessions/wilson/)” at [IWMW 2008 in Aberdeen next week](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/workshops/webmaster-2008/).

Self-promotion over, back to your jobs people (while you still have them!).
