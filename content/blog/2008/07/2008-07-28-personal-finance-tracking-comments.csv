Also can’t you group by vendor using grep, if you convert to the wonderful csv format?

The last thing is that you graph is too small for me to see what you are spending."

The vendor stuff isn’t hard and you’re right, it should just be a simple grep procedure, but I also want to be able to assign a ‘friendly’ name to vendors and group by that. It should all be straightforward, but frankly banks should be providing all of this already.

I’ll make a note to put a larger screenshot up next time 😉"

I use it and it is pretty nice. It can aggregate data from a lot of different financial institutions and provide comprehensive graphs – though they are all pretty much pie charts and not line graphs.

There is another site, mint.com, that offers nicer graphs but in the back end they still use Yodlee for data fetching/aggregation."

Since I am paying off debt, and really constantly strive to be frugal and save money on every area of spending, I really want to be aware of where I am overspending. It helps me to make sure that I stick to my budget and it helps me to see problem areas if I manually keep track of my spending using excel. I save all my receipts and I also sign on to online banking about once or twice a week. I enter the data from the receipts and from my bank account into my spreadsheet, and have created my own custom categories to track my spending. Yes, it definitely is more work- but this way I am constantly aware of where my money is going and if I am potentially going to go over budget in any area. Since I tried a cash only and/or envelope system and it didn’t work for me, this is the best way to ensure that my frugality efforts are paying off."
