It’s been a long, long day, but at least I got to watch the final episode of Dr Who when I got home.

I wasn’t as inspired by the talks as [other](http://twitter.com/libbymiller/statuses/850859191 "Libby's tweet") [people](http://twitter.com/psd/statuses/850851854 "psd's tweet") seem to have been – the ones I attended seemed reasonably prosaic, although I did make a couple of notes to follow up on later. I think this means I need to change the criteria I use for choosing which talks I go to.

The social aspect was great though; the attendees, both speakers and audience alike, were awesome – a real cream of the crop. It might always be like that at London gatherings, I don’t know but it seemed great to me! Of couse, my view is probably tainted by the fact that I got to shake hands with [Ben Goldacre](http://badscience.net/) (as I simpered like a girl).

Things I learned:

- phones are rubbish for quick twitter entry
- the [official opentech online schedule](http://www.ukuug.org/events/opentech2008/schedule/) was rubbish. Everyone was using [Jeremy Keith’s version](http://adactio.com/extras/schedules/opentech2008/)
- there appears to be a [real change happening in the civil service wrt technology](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/iam/codes/social_media/participation.asp) thanks to people like William Perrin, John Sheridan and many more
- stopping people in corridors and introducing yourself works surprisingly well
- [confabb](http://www.confabb.com/) is a hosted multi-even [ripplerap](http://ripplerap.com/) site
- the [BUG modules](http://buglabs.net/products) are surprisingly small and the touchscreen surprisingly temperamental, and the toolkit uses [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)

At the moment there are only two of the dozens of presentations on [slideshare](http://slideshare.net/tag/opentech), but I hope they will be gathered together somewhere at some point soon.

Incidentally, [Sir Bonar has written an excellent summary of the day](http://www.idealgovernment.com/index.php/blog/comments/1676/ "The closed book called OpenTech").
