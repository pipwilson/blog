Not that I don’t think that just about every TED talk is great, but this one entitled “[What’s wrong with what we eat](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/mark_bittman_on_what_s_wrong_with_what_we_eat.html)” by Mark Bittman resonates with how I think about what my wife and I eat.

It turns out we eat around the recommended levels of meat a week (and certainly nothing like the average US figures) but the *quality* of what we do eat is quite low. I’ve been thinking about getting in to work earlier just so that I’ll have time when I get home to cook a better meal.

Enough of me, here’s the talk:
