Could you elaborate on why you thought the layout of the schedule was rubbish? We can then look at fixing it for next year

Glad you enjoyed the day.

To be fair it got better before the event when the abstracts loaded underneath each section rather than by the side, but we’d have been better off had the abstracts been duplicated elsewhere and linked from the talk’s title, leaving the ajax out of the schedule altogether (I see from the source that they were actually separate files, included with jquery). I think having seen the side-loading version, the damage was done for me; first impressions and all that. I guess it didn’t help that abstracts varied from nothing to about three hundred words which, when dynamically loaded into the page meant that before clicking you didn’t know where the rest of the page was going to go.

You could also have done with a print stylesheet which disabled the sidebar and big heading.

Had Jeremy’s version had speaker names on it and linked through to the abstracts, it would have been perfect imho."
