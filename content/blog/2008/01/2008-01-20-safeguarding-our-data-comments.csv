Pretty much none, none, and none, respectively. The Information Commissioner is a voice in the wind on this sort of thing, tragically enough. I appreciate that it’s the civil service rather than the government who are actually the problem here, but the government could compel the civil service to actually \_give a toss\_ about our data without even trying hard, and they’re not doing it."
