Mainly to download ringtones and other such things. I’ve only used it myself once, so I just assumed Nokia had the required software pre-installed on their phones.

From my experience, they weren’t particularly useful but that may be because phone bandwidth at the time was terrible. I also don’t think that the US mobile market, both in terms of user expectations and handset capabilities, if a very fair reflection of the global market. Maybe it’s changed recently though"

I’m pretty proficient technically, with a great phone that supports this stuff out of the box (a Nokia N95), and it just would not work. I spent several minutes trying to grab one of these (and ultimately failing), when it would have taken 30 seconds to type in a URL. Perhaps I was doing something wrong, but I really don’t care: it’s not intuitive enough or as fast as typing, even on a handset."

Two things to bear in mind:

1\) not all codes that look like this are QR codes. There are multiple standards, although QR codes are the most common

2\) Make sure it is set to “close up mode”.

Try scanning the QR code on this page. For me it works if I pretty much just swipe the screen."

Why should we waste people’s time with codes that they may or may not be able to use when some text would suffice?"
1267,2008-01-31T20:27:54+00:00,Phil,blog@philwilson.org,http://philwilson.org/blog/,comment,0,"Well, the only non-QR codes I’ve seen in the flesh have been on items sent through the post where they use a QR-like square of blots. It’s just worth knowing in case that really was your problem.

To make that very clear: all the other codes I’ve seen (over a number of years) have been immediately usable and delivered content in seconds that would have taken minutes to type in (QR codes can be grouped in grids to provide greater amounts of information)."

BTW – the URL thing is real pain, as a mobile developer it’s really annoying having to type in those URLs to download things."
