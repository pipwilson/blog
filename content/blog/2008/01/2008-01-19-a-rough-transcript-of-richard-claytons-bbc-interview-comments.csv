The main problem was that the contractors and developers – under intense pressure from the Govt. built stations that were too big to kept safe in the event of any emergency. You can see the same weird “macho” thinking still at work here – they want \*all\* the data – \*everyone’s\* data all in the one super-duper-sized database. Of course if they get what they’re pressuring for – that too will inevitably go into it’s own spectacular meltdown.

God – these people are slooooow learners."
