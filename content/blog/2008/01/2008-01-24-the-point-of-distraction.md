It turns out that I hate having the mouse cursor visible in my working window. I didnâ€™t really know about this until I used a colleagueâ€™s dual-monitor machine. He has set the window focus to follow the pointer and I consistently selected the window I wanted to type in and one whoosh of the mouse later was happily typing code into Firefox.

It turns out that this doesnâ€™t really work ðŸ™‚

After I went back to my machine I tried to pay attention to what I was doing with the mouse after Iâ€™ve selected a window, and I do indeed almost always give it a quick flick left or right and take the pointer to the edge of the screen where itâ€™s out of my way.

So it means Iâ€™m glad to find out about [unclutter](http://debaday.debian.net/2007/03/27/unclutter-hide-the-mouse-cursor-after-a-period-of-inactivity/) ([via Erik](http://www.eriksmartt.com/blog/archives/418)), a small Linux application for hiding the mouse pointer after a customised period of delay. Much nicer!
