I almost feel bad about this, but it seems like this sacred cow is more like [Shambo](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6643729.stm).

> sometimes the elders are right, and the youngsters really are too young to know the history of the idea they think that they’ve just invented.

Unfortunately [for Joel](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/29.html), [QR codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) have been around for over a decade and work very, very well (they’re most well-known in Japan where they appear on virtually every item you can buy, but when British tabloid newspapers like [The Sun are starting to run them](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article543394.ece), you know they’re making inroads in the UK too).![The QR code for this blog](http://philwilson.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/qrcode.png)

Given that he’s talking about mobile phones, and that he says <q>typing URLs is not hard</q>, I can only imagine that *he’s never actually done it*. Typing URLs on a mobile phone keyboard is an awful, awful experience. If it’s anything other than a simple [www.something.com](http://www.something.com) you may as well not even bother, because you’ll probably make a typo anyway. Why do you think there are so many “text us this word on this number and we’ll send you the URL” services?

Unluckily for the <q>consumers who are expected to install new software on their phones</q> line, he also doesn’t seem to realise that some phones **do** now come with QR code readers built in. Oh dear.

From my point of view, where I’ve been watching QR codes for about seven years, they’ve always seemed like a good idea, but the mobile technology in the West has just been too poor to be able to use them. Now that every man and his dog has a phone which incorporates a 2MP camera and a fully-featured web browser (none of this WAP rubbish) it’s easy to see them becoming more and more popular.

This blogger thinks that Joel should stick to commenting on software, and leave the mobile tech world well alone.
