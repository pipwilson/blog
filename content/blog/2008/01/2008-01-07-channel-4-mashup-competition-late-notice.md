It turns out that [Channel4 are running a mashup competition](http://www.channel4.com/interact/platform4/contest.html). You have to use one of their Film4 feeds and mash it up with another source of content in some way.

First place is a cash prize of £1,500 with two runner-up prizes of £250 each. Of course, any submission you make can be used, cost-free by them in perpetuity ([here are the rest of the rules](http://www.channel4.com/interact/platform4/rules.html)).

The deadline is this Thursday, so good luck!
