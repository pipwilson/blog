I do not listen to many podcasts. This is mainly because I used to have trouble syncing a subscription list across multiple PCs. Now I have [a Nokia N95](http://philwilson.org/blog/2007/11/nokia-n95-assessment) I use that as my primary client. It works well and I have started adding some feeds.

I don’t listen to music podcasts though – I’ve tried and they are almost always too long and players don’t allow me to add a bookmark a place in the hour-long mp3 where I actually liked a song and want to look it up later, or mark a point where someone mentions a URL or whatever.

Also the default media player won’t store information for submission to [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/pipthepixie). I also use [Symbian OggPlay](http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/), an open source C++ app which I’m tempted to see if I build a binary from and add played items storage (although it might just be easier to write from from scratch in Python if all my podcasts are mp3s).

This means the core of my subscriptions are these:

- [Digital Planet](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/digitalp/) (BBC)
- [Friday Night Comedy/The Now Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/fricomedy/) (BBC)
- [LugRadio](http://lugradio.org/) (some blokes)
- [Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo’s film reviews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/kermode/) (BBC)
- [Pods and Blogs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/pods/) (BBC)
- [Russell Howard and Jon Richardson](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/rh6m/) (BBC)
- [Voice of S60](http://blogs.s60.com/voiceofs60/) (Symbian)

The BBC’s new musc podcasts are all under 15 minutes (AFAIK), which makes them easily searchable and I’ve subscribed to these:

- [Music Week](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/musicweek/) (BBC)
- [Radio 1 Indie Weekly](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/r1indie/) (BBC)
- [Radio 1 Introducing…](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/huwintro/) (BBC)
- [Radio 1 Mini Mix](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/r1mix/) (BBC)
- [Radio 1 Rock Show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/r1rock/) (BBC)
- [Zane Lowe’s Hottest Records](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/zane/) (BBC)

I just about manage to listen to all of these in a week, but I do feel like I’m missing out on some “new music revelation” by not having an adequate player for long music podcasts like [those that Alf recommends](http://hublog.hubmed.org/tags/podcasts). Is there anything out there?
