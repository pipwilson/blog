I’ll be moving to <http://www.slicehost.com/> on their lowest tariff (which is cheaper for better specs!). Slicehost were recently bought by Rackspace but I’m hoping this won’t impact me 🙂"

Although looks like I’ll need to fiddle with Nginx or lighttpd to sail under the vicious memory cap. And maybe even put my website up there at some point 🙂"
