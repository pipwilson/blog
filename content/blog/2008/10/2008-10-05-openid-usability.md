People complain a lot that users don’t understand about OpenID logins booting them to another website to authenticate.

Don’t Google already do this with Blogger and Yahoo with Flickr? That is to say: don’t tens of millions of people do this regularly already?

I mean, what’s the big difference? I know there are other usability complaints/problems, but this one sounds eerily like a straw man to me.
