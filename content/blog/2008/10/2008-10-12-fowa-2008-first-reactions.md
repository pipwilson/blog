This was my first time at [FOWA](http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/). There were some [really good talks](http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2008/london/content), but the focus on “where’s the money?” and “how do I monetise that?” was fundamentally depressing. This is a clear indication to me that I am not cut out to be an entrepreneur. I do the job for the love, not the money.
